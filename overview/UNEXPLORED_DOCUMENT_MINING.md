## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

This report documents a systematic deep search across four databases containing 3.5M+ records from the DOJ's Epstein document corpus. The investigation targeted five specific areas: surveillance/recording systems, undiscovered named individuals in redacted text, medical/scientific connections, law enforcement failures, and financial mysteries. Over 40 distinct queries were executed. Findings are organized by investigation area with all EFTA document identifiers cited.

> **[UPDATE — 2026-02-12]** This report was written using four databases totaling 3,477,673 records. The full corpus now contains 1,380,937 documents (2,731,796 pages) across all 12 datasets in full_text_corpus.db (4.79 GB). Several "ZERO results" findings below have been overturned by DS9/DS11 expansion; corrections are noted inline.

## 1. SURVEILLANCE AND RECORDING SYSTEMS

### 1A. Epstein's Palm Beach Camera-in-Clock Surveillance System (CONFIRMED)

**[EFTA02731226](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2012/EFTA02731226.pdf)** (Maxwell Prosecution Memo, page 12):
> "Epstein had cameras in his clock... and that the FBI was surveilling Epstein's residence"

This is a significant surveillance finding: the Maxwell prosecution memo references Epstein having "cameras in his clock." The FBI CID summary ([EFTA00038617](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00038617.pdf)) stated "these searches did not reveal any cameras in any of the bedrooms or massage rooms" — a more limited claim than "no cameras." The prosecution memo's reference to clock cameras raises questions about what cameras may have existed outside bedrooms and massage rooms.

**[EFTA00029761](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00029761.pdf)** (Palm Beach Police Department Incident Report, 2003):
> Epstein "purchased a [camera] from a store on Okeechobee Blvd. and had set up [a] clock in his office facing the [area]... camera system monitoring the [house]... image on his computer hard drive"

This 2003 police report documents that Epstein purchased a spy camera, concealed it inside a clock in his office, and monitored footage on his computer. **Important context:** The camera was set up specifically **to catch a burglar stealing cash from his briefcase** — not as part of a sexual abuse surveillance system. The burglar (a former employee) was identified and confessed. However, this does demonstrate that Epstein had the technical capability and inclination to use concealed camera technology as early as 2003.

### 1B. Maxell T-160 Time Lapse Recording Tapes (PHYSICAL EVIDENCE)

**[EFTA00007741](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%204/EFTA00007741.pdf), [EFTA00007984](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%204/EFTA00007984.pdf), [EFTA00007987](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%204/EFTA00007987.pdf), [EFTA00007990](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%204/EFTA00007990.pdf)** (Dataset 4 - seized evidence):
- Physical Maxell P/I Plus T-160 VHS tapes labeled "Ideal for use in Time Lapse Recording"
- These are **professional surveillance VHS tapes** designed specifically for time-lapse security recording systems
- Evidence tags indicate these were seized from Epstein properties
- OCR confirms: "ITEM WAS NOT SCANNED" / "DESCRIPTION: VHS Tape" -- these tapes were cataloged but their **content was never digitized**

**[EFTA01721030](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01721030.pdf), [EFTA01721063](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01721063.pdf), [EFTA01721069](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01721069.pdf)** (Dataset 10 duplicates of same tapes)

### 1C. NiceVision/Qognify Surveillance System (MCC, NOT Epstein's -- but critical)

**[EFTA00036276](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00036276.pdf)** (14-page surveillance equipment purchase order):
- NiceVision H.264 Encoder: 22 units, supporting 16 cameras each = **352 camera channels**, $54,862.50
- Enterprise software upgrade for 350 video channels: $83,790.00
- This is an MCC surveillance equipment order, NOT from Epstein's property

**[EFTA00036156](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00036156.pdf)** (NICEVision Administrator Error email):
- References a "NICEVision Administrator Error" at the MCC facility
- MCC was running NiceVision/Qognify software for its surveillance system

**[EFTA00036168](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00036168.pdf)** (NICE/Qognify Installation Check list):
- Detailed installation checklist for NVR servers, encoders, decoders
- References "existing Analog PTZ camera address settings"
- Documents the MCC's hybrid analog/digital surveillance infrastructure

### 1D. CCTV at Epstein Property (Little St. James / Other)

**[EFTA00001584](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%201/EFTA00001584.pdf)** (Construction/renovation document):
- Line item: "CCTV/Wet" at cost of $4,350.00
- Part of a larger renovation budget including theater equipment
- Confirms CCTV was installed at an Epstein property during construction/renovation

### 1E. MCC DVR System Failure Timeline (Death Night)

**[EFTA01649190](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01649190.pdf)** (MCC Video System diagram -- CRITICAL):
```
Total: 192 Cameras / 128 Cameras
DVR 1: 16 Hard drives - functioning
  - 2 camera angles of interest record to DVR 1
  - Data available 7/23 - 8/10
DVR 2: 16 Hard drives
  - DVR 2 System failure on 7/29
  - DVR 2 Hard drive failure (2 hard drives) on 8/8
  - Only available video 7/15-7/29
  - 3 of 4 camera angles of interest in the SHU record to DVR 2
  - Sally port camera (elevator bank #1 and #2)
```

This means **3 out of 4 cameras covering Epstein's area were NOT recording** on the night of his death. The sally port camera (entry/exit point) was on the failed DVR 2 system.

**[EFTA01656173](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01656173.pdf), [EFTA01656152](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01656152.pdf), [EFTA01656198](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01656198.pdf), [EFTA01660622](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01660622.pdf)** (FBI Briefing versions):
> "Approximately 450 hours of video from 7/23... Approximately 150 cameras total in MCC... DVR2 - system failure on 7/29/2019... #2 system was not recording. On 8/8/2019, BOP learned that DVR... recording. On 8/8/2019, BOP learned that DVR [had failed]"

**[EFTA00039025](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00039025.pdf)** (OIG Report, 125+ pages, pp. 25-26):
> "MCC New York staff obtain the replacement hard drives to repair the institution's security camera system but do not complete the repairs necessary to restore recording functionality"
> "MCC New York's failure to ensure that its security camera system was fully functional and make timely repairs is consistent with the OIG's previous observations regarding weaknesses in the BOP's overall system of security cameras. Dating back to at least 2013, the OIG has repeatedly observed inadequacies"

> **UPDATE (Revisit, 2026-02-12):** Per [EFTA01649190](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01649190.pdf), replacement drives were obtained but **never installed** before Epstein's death. The OIG report ([EFTA00039025](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00039025.pdf)) is confirmed at 125+ pages.

### 1F. FBI Seizure of DVR Systems Post-Death

**[EFTA02730741](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2012/EFTA02730741.pdf)** (FBI case file index, page 206):

> "As of today approximately 6:15 AM Electronic Technician informed me that here at MCC NY we have a total of 161 cameras. At this time we are recording on the new system 141-146 cameras we need to work on 15-20 cameras to get them operational"

So **15-20 cameras were still non-operational** 5 days after Epstein's death.

**[EFTA00036107](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00036107.pdf)** ($800,000 Camera Replacement budget):
> "Camera Replacement: $800,000.00"
- Federal Bureau of Prisons, Metropolitan Detention Center budget document
- $800K allocated for camera replacement

### 1H. Recording Capability Disruption (FBI Taking NVR)

**[EFTA00036630](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00036630.pdf), [EFTA00036632](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00036632.pdf), [EFTA00036633](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00036633.pdf)** (Recording capability emails):
> "The FBI is going to be retrieving the previous recordings from our camera system at MCC, but because we were having difficulty retrieving the recordings, they have told us the recording capabilities will be off line for up to 8-10 days while they retrieve this data. We will still have live viewing/monitoring."
> "So they're taking the NVR? Do we know the make/model so that as an option we could get with the vendor and get an emergency replacement?"
> "Signet will be on site tomorrow to try and connect the new NVR's."

### 1I. Palm Beach Bike Path Cameras -- Evidence NOT Preserved

**[EFTA00020778](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00020778.pdf)** (Tipster email to law enforcement, Feb 2019):
> "Last night a source extended dates on bike path. Epstein riding with young girl to Feb 21. 2 sightings between Feb 13-21, 2019."
> "He explained cameras only keep video for 3 months. That first incident happened sometime in Nov. I was told January. Nothing was done to follow up."

Public surveillance cameras that may have captured Epstein with a young girl were **not preserved** because they only retained 3 months of footage and law enforcement failed to act.

### 1J. Videocamera Delivery to Terje Rod-Larsen

**[EFTA01809341](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01809341.pdf)** (Email to Rod-Larsen):
> Subject: "Videocamera Delivery"

**[EFTA00016904](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00016904.pdf)** (Email about preserved surveillance):
> "It is our understanding that there is video surveillance in the hallway in or near the tier that was preserved in reference to the July 23 incident. We would like to see a copy of it."
> "It is our understanding that there may be photographs or a video recording of cell 124 that would have been taken shortly a[fter]"

### 1N. Boies/Pottinger Secret Videos Scheme

**[EFTA00032751](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00032751.pdf)** (OCR from legal filing):
> "Boies and Pottinger were planning to utilize the illicit videos to obtain multi-million-dollar settlements from the wealthy men."
> "This conduct was the subject of Episode 22 of The Weekly... confirmed that the purpose of the plan was to get these wealthy men to pay money in exchange for what Boies described in his interview as 'peace.'"
> "As described, Mr. Boies's conduct amounts to conspiracy to commit extortion"

David Boies (prominent attorney) and Stan Pottinger planned to use Epstein's secret recordings of wealthy men for extortion-style "settlements."

### 1O. Cassette Tapes Discovery Issue

**[EFTA00028585](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00028585.pdf)** (Discovery dispute, April 2021):

## 2. UNDISCOVERED NAMED INDIVIDUALS IN REDACTED TEXT

### 2A. Stephen Hawking -- Contact Information Shared

**[EFTA02076108](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA02076108.pdf)** (Redacted email):
> Subject: "S. Hawking's contact info"
- Epstein's office sharing Stephen Hawking's contact information
- Single document, but corroborated by OCR finding:

**[EFTA00018466](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00018466.pdf)** (SDNY News Clips):

### 2B. Larry Summers -- EXTENSIVE Document Trail (2,000+ in full corpus)

> **UPDATE (Revisit, 2026-02-12):** The original search found 30+ documents. The expanded full corpus (1,380,937 docs) contains **2,000+ documents** referencing Summers, including direct emails 2013-2018 such as "central bank mongol does not like imf idea" ([EFTA02484293](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02484293.pdf)), active NYC meetups ([EFTA02233990](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02233990.pdf)), and the Wigdor victim allegation ([EFTA02731721](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2012/EFTA02731721.pdf)).

Larry Summers (former Treasury Secretary, Harvard President) has one of the densest document trails of any named individual:

Previously documented (Session 6-7):
- **[EFTA02731721](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2012/EFTA02731721.pdf)**: Wigdor victim trafficked to Larry Summers
- **[EFTA02674889](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02674889.pdf)**: Summers to Epstein: "I spoke for your friend Leon Black's investor event today. Thought of you."
- **[EFTA02484293](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02484293.pdf)**: Summers-Epstein: "central bank mongol does not like imf idea, too much transparency"
- **[EFTA02233990](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02233990.pdf)**: Summers actively seeking Epstein in NYC (Dec 2017)
- **[EFTA00362483](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00362483.pdf)**: Calendar day with Barak, Black, Summers, Thiel ALL visiting Epstein

**NEW FINDING - "Summers withdrawal"** ([EFTA01957627](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01957627.pdf), [EFTA01957748](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01957748.pdf)): The subject line "Summers withdrawal" could refer to either a financial withdrawal or Summers withdrawing from a position/commitment. Given that Summers withdrew his candidacy for Federal Reserve Chair in 2013, this may be Epstein tracking that political development.

### 2C. Steven Pinker -- Single Reference

**[EFTA02039071](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA02039071.pdf)** (page 28): "StevenPinker"
- Single reference in redacted text
- Corroborated by OCR ([EFTA00018466](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00018466.pdf)): Pinker described Epstein as an "intellectual impostor" who attended "salons and coffee klatsches" organized by Martin Nowak and Lawrence Krauss

### 2D. Kevin Spacey -- Clinton Africa Trip

**[EFTA00019249](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00019249.pdf)** (News article in corpus):
> "Epstein, whose enormous and unexplained wealth attracted a circle of friends that included Bill Clinton, Donald Trump, actor Kevin Spacey and Britain's Prince Andrew"

**[EFTA00013640](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00013640.pdf)** (Original NY Magazine profile):
> "He's pals with a passel of Nobel Prize-winning scientists, CEOs like Leslie Wexner of the Limited, socialite Ghislaine Maxwell, even Donald Trump. But it wasn't until he flew Clinton, Kevin Spacey, and Chris Tucker to Africa on his private Boeing 727"

Spacey appears exclusively in news articles within the corpus. **No direct communications or redacted references** to Spacey were found in the 3.5M+ redaction records.

### 2E. Ron Burkle -- News Articles Only

**[EFTA00013635](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00013635.pdf)** (NY Magazine article):
> "this year's chattering-class billionaire, Ron Burkle, the mysterious 53-year-old who made his fortune in the very non-mysterious business of investing in supermarkets. Burkle -- who also works with President Clinton -- is a fixture at the Mercer Hotel"
> "Supermarket billionaire Ron Burkle, Virgin head Richard Branson, and Steve Bing"

Burkle appears in news articles describing the NYC social scene Epstein inhabited. **No direct communications found in redacted text.**

### 2F. George Mitchell -- CONFIRMED in Victim Accusation

**[EFTA00022133](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00022133.pdf)** (9-page victim accusation compilation):
> "Epstein and Maxwell told her to have sex with former New Mexico governor Bill Richardson; former Democratic Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell; the late MIT computer scientist Marvin Minsky"

**[EFTA02731420](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2012/EFTA02731420.pdf)** (Victim journal -- CONFIDENTIAL):
> "even old senators like George Mitchell who you think would be good like a grandpa are bad."

This is a direct victim statement naming George Mitchell as an abuser.

### 2G. NEGATIVE FINDINGS -- Names NOT Found

The following names returned **ZERO results** across the databases available at time of initial search (primary text database, DS10 text database, OCR text records, image catalog). Subsequent expansion to the full 12-dataset corpus (1,380,937 docs) overturned several of these findings as noted:

- **Rupert Murdoch**: Zero results
- **Steven Spielberg**: Zero results
- **David Geffen**: Zero results (only "Geffen" false positives from metadata)
- **Steven Mnuchin**: Zero results (only appears in unrelated NTOC tipster rants about Trump administration - [EFTA00010786](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00010786.pdf))
- **Henry Kissinger**: ~~Zero results~~ **OVERTURNED (Revisit, 2026-02-12):** 431 documents found in the full corpus. Kissinger appears on a 2014 dinner party list ([EFTA00284908](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00284908.pdf)) alongside Black, Barak, Summers, Staley, Blankfein, and Allen.

### 4A. William Barr's Split Recusal

**[EFTA00018398](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00018398.pdf)** (News article in corpus):
> "Department official on Tuesday said that Barr consulted with career ethics officials and concluded he did not have to recuse himself from the current prosecution"
> "Barr's decision to have oversight over the Epstein prosecution came on the [same day that another official] had recused himself from the case"

**[EFTA00028149](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00028149.pdf)** (Epstein defense legal issues email):
> "the SD Fla was ordered recused by the DOJ"
> "DOJ from criminal matters"
> "involved in the CVRA case"

The Southern District of Florida was formally **ordered recused by the DOJ** from Epstein criminal matters due to the CVRA (Crime Victims' Rights Act) violations. Meanwhile, Barr chose NOT to recuse himself despite his former law firm Kirkland & Ellis having represented Epstein.

### 4B. Alfredo Rodriguez Obstruction Case

**[EFTA01326080](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01326080.pdf)-01326156** (Multiple FBI documents):
> "ALFREDO RODRIGUEZ; OBSTRUCTION OF JUSTICE"
> Case ID: 72-MM-113327
- Rodriguez was Epstein's house manager who tried to sell the "black book" with handwritten notes
- FBI opened an obstruction case against Rodriguez rather than following up on the evidence he tried to provide
- Rodriguez died before he could testify further

**[EFTA01660622](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01660622.pdf)** (FBI Briefing, page 3):
> "opened an obstruction of justice case with [employ]ee of Epstein. Rodriguez failed to comply [and hand] all the requested documents... black book and handwritten notes regarding [schedule]"
> "undercover operation"
> "months"

### 4C. Evidence Tampering Concerns

**[EFTA00016349](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00016349.pdf)** (Legal document):
> "tampering with evidence, or intimidation... jeopardize the investigation"
- Reference to potential evidence tampering or witness intimidation in the Epstein case

**[EFTA00028585](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00028585.pdf)** (Discovery dispute):
> "cassette tapes, so recordings were converted"
> "no metadata was [available]... from SDNY005 (October 20, 2020)"
- Cassette tapes from Epstein properties were converted without metadata preservation

### 4D. DVR Hard Drive Failures as Evidence Destruction

**[EFTA00039025](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00039025.pdf)** (OIG Report):
> "MCC New York staff obtain the replacement hard drives to repair the institution's security camera system but do not complete the repairs necessary to restore recording functionality and address long-standing performance failures with the institution's DVR 2 system."

The OIG found that:
- DVR 2 failed on 7/29/2019 (11 days before death)
- 2 additional hard drives failed on 8/8/2019 (2 days before death)
- Replacement hard drives were obtained **but not installed** before Epstein's death
- 3 of 4 camera angles covering Epstein's SHU tier recorded to the failed DVR 2

**[EFTA00017950](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00017950.pdf)** (MCC memo):
> "DVR system #2 had two to three hard drives fail causing most of that system to stop recording. Two of the three camera feeds of obvious interest resided on DVR system #2, meaning they were not recording at the time of the suicide on 08/10/19."

### 4E. VHS Tapes Not Digitized

**[EFTA00023673](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00023673.pdf), [EFTA00023957](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00023957.pdf), [EFTA00026741](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00026741.pdf)** (Discovery discussions):

> "including VHS, cassette"
- VHS tapes from Epstein properties were discussed in discovery but the evidence labels show "ITEM WAS NOT SCANNED"

### 4F. CSAM Discovery in Estate Settlement (2023)

**[EFTA00039019](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00039019.pdf), [EFTA00039008](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00039008.pdf), [EFTA00039011](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00039011.pdf)** (FBI/Estate emails, April 2023):
> "Thank you for reaching out regarding the potential discovery of CSAM."
> FBI Special Agent, Child Exploitation/Human Trafficking contacted
> Estate executor (Daniel Ruzumna) discovered CSAM while processing documents for USVI settlement

Child sexual abuse material was discovered **during estate settlement in 2023** -- years after Epstein's death -- suggesting not all digital evidence was properly reviewed during the initial investigation.

### 4G. Surveillance Tip Ignored (Feb 2019)

**[EFTA00020778](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00020778.pdf)** (Tipster email):
> "Epstein riding with young girl to Feb 21. 2 sightings between Feb 13-21, 2019."
> "He explained cameras only keep video for 3 months. That first incident happened sometime in Nov. I was told January. Nothing was done to follow up."

Multiple witnesses reported Epstein with young girls on Palm Beach bike paths in late 2018 and early 2019. The local police chief was informed but **nothing was done to follow up**, and surveillance camera footage was lost after 3 months.

The Austin Hill introduction and Blockchain Capital IV $15M investment are now documented in forensic_workbench.db. However, deeper analysis of the Bitcoin troika, LedgerX relationship, and Mongolia crypto channels remains warranted.

## 8. CRITICAL GAPS AND UNRESOLVED QUESTIONS

1. **Where are the VHS time-lapse tapes' contents?** Physical Maxell T-160 tapes were seized from Epstein properties but labeled "ITEM WAS NOT SCANNED." These professional surveillance tapes could contain recordings from Epstein's hidden camera system.

2. **What was on DVR 2?** Three of four camera angles covering Epstein's SHU tier recorded to DVR 2, which failed. The FBI seized the DVR systems but the extracted content has never been made public.

3. **Who is the "Bitcoin troika"?** Epstein referenced a group of three people involved in Bitcoin dealings. Given the $15M Blockchain Capital IV investment through the 2017 Caterpillar Trust, this represents a significant unexplored financial channel.

4. **What is in the "Epstein-Cryptology?" file?** Three separate documents reference a file or folder with this name. Cryptology could refer to cryptocurrency, but it could also refer to encryption of communications or files.

5. **Who are the names behind the "Murdoch/Spielberg/Geffen/Kissinger" zeros?** The complete absence of these names from 3.5M+ records could indicate: (a) no connection existed, (b) connections were maintained through channels not captured in the DOJ corpus, or (c) names were successfully redacted/removed before document production.

> **[UPDATE — 2026-02-12]** The "Kissinger: ZERO results" finding has been **overturned**: 431 documents reference Kissinger in full_text_corpus.db. [EFTA00284908](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00284908.pdf) places Kissinger on a 2014 dinner party guest list alongside Black, Barak, Summers, Staley, Blankfein, and Allen. Separately, "Lauder: ZERO results" has also been overturned (463 docs), with Ronald Lauder Clinique Foundation appearing in the email corpus. Murdoch, Spielberg, and Geffen remain at zero or near-zero in the full corpus.

6. **What happened to the diamonds?** Defense counsel was requesting return of diamonds, ring, and funds in August 2019. The disposition of 48 loose diamonds (some over 2 carats) and a large diamond ring is unknown.

7. **What was the "Proposal for BMGF"?** A formal proposal for the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation was being coordinated through Epstein's network with UN diplomat Rod-Larsen. The substance of this proposal has not been identified.
