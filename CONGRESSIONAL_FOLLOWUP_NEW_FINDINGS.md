# CONGRESSIONAL FOLLOW-UP: Additional Critical Documents
## Findings from the February 2026 Full-Corpus Revisit (Datasets 9-12)
### Supplement to the [CONGRESSIONAL_READING_GUIDE.md](CONGRESSIONAL_READING_GUIDE.md)

---

## WHAT THIS IS

After the original Congressional Reading Guide was compiled from Datasets 1-8, the full-corpus revisit (all 12 datasets, 1,380,937 documents) uncovered **dozens of additional critical documents** that were not in the original guide. This supplement identifies those documents, organized by priority.

**These documents are NEW to the congressional lists.** Every EFTA below was verified as absent from both [CONGRESSIONAL_READING_GUIDE.md](CONGRESSIONAL_READING_GUIDE.md) and [CONGRESS_RAW_EFTA_LIST.md](CONGRESS_RAW_EFTA_LIST.md).

---

## TIER 1: THE FBI INTELLIGENCE FILE (5 documents)

**This is the single biggest gap in the original congressional reading lists.**

The DOJ released an FBI Confidential Human Source report (FD-1023 format) in Dataset 9 that contains the most explicit intelligence-connection claims in the entire 218GB corpus. It was not in the original lists because it did not exist in Datasets 1-8.

| # | EFTA | What It Is | What To Look For |
|---|------|-----------|-----------------|
| 1 | **[EFTA00090314](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00090314.pdf)** | FBI CHS FD-1023 (3 pages). Filed 10/19/2020, Source S-00099701, LA Field Office. Case numbers include "INTELPRODS" (intelligence products channel). | **The CHS states:** (1) Dershowitz told Acosta that Epstein "belonged to both U.S. and allied intelligence services"; (2) Epstein "trained as a spy under" former Israeli PM Ehud Barak; (3) "Mossad would then call Dershowitz to debrief" after Epstein-related calls; (4) Dershowitz was "co-opted by Mossad." **Congress must ask FBI:** Was this CHS claim ever verified or investigated? What actions resulted from the filing? |
| 2 | **[EFTA00098755](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00098755.pdf)** | Investigative memo (p.4) | **States:** "Jeffrey Epstein worked for the United States government as a financial bounty hunter. He has retained significant political connections with both Israel and the United States." **Who wrote this memo? On what basis?** "Recent known recruiters include [REDACTED]" **Who was recruiting? Who was expected to cooperate?** "Important New York Witnesses: [REDACTED]" **This file, if unredacted, should be incredibly revealing.** |
| 3 | **[EFTA01013272](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA01013272.pdf)** | Barak-Epstein email exchange (December 2018, 6 months before arrest) | Barak: "you should make clear that i dont work for mossad :)" / Epstein: "unfortunately, not." **Was this ironic denial or coded communication?** |
| 4 | **[EFTA00129096](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00129096.pdf)** | FBI ARMS investigation document | Identifies **Masha Drokova** as "nicknamed 'PUTIN's kiss,' former publicist for JEFFREY EPSTEIN." Connected to Day One Ventures, Quantum Wave Fund, Runa Capital, and Russian technology transfer concerns. Regular 2017 meetings with Epstein documented. **Active FBI counterintelligence interest in an Epstein associate connected to Putin's Russia.** |
| 5 | **[EFTA00076059](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00076059.pdf)** | Three copies (also /76060, /97444) of Daily Beast "belonged to intelligence" article | Circulated within SDNY prosecution on **July 9, 2019 -- the day of arrest** -- forwarded to Geoffrey Berman (USANYS) with "For our next discussion." **What was that "next discussion"? What did SDNY conclude about the intelligence allegations?** |

**Context:** The original CONGRESSIONAL_READING_GUIDE cited Acosta's OPR interview intelligence asset exchange ([EFTA00009116](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%207/EFTA00009116.pdf), pp. 404-405 — Acosta explicitly denied the claim twice but referenced classified information in the same exchange) and the FOIA exemption ([EFTA00015219](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00015219.pdf)), but did not include the FD-1023 itself. The FD-1023 is an unverified CHS report -- not an FBI conclusion -- but its existence in the FBI case file, filed through an intelligence channel ("INTELPRODS"), means these claims were received and preserved as investigative leads.

## TIER 2: CURRENT GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS (13 documents)

**These documents concern individuals currently or recently serving in the U.S. government.** None were in the original guide because the government officials corpus search was completed after those lists were published.

## TIER 4: POWER CONVERGENCE DINNERS (5 documents)

**These documents show Epstein's network converging in a single room.** The original guide included the September 22, 2014 calendar day ([EFTA00362483](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00362483.pdf)), but missed the full dinner guest lists.
