# CONGRESSIONAL READING GUIDE: Epstein Unredacted Files
## Compiled from forensic analysis of 218GB DOJ release (DataSets 1-12)
### For Members of Congress viewing unredacted files at DOJ, starting Feb 9, 2026

---

## HOW TO USE THIS GUIDE

You have **no electronic devices** and can only take **handwritten notes**. Documents are organized by EFTA number (e.g., [EFTA01660622](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01660622.pdf)). This guide is organized from **most impactful to least**, with the single most important question for each document: **What name is behind the redaction?**

**Time estimates:** Each "tier" below is roughly 2-3 hours of reading. Tier 1 alone would be groundbreaking.

---

## TIER 1: THE 20 DOCUMENTS THAT MATTER MOST

These are the documents where redactions are obviously protecting powerful people from accountability, where victims named perpetrators and those names were blacked out, or where institutional failures are being concealed.

### 1A. THE FBI MASTER BRIEFING — WHO IS NAMED?

| # | EFTA | Pages | What It Is | What To Look For |
|---|------|-------|-----------|-----------------|
| 1 | **[EFTA01660622](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01660622.pdf)** | 17+ | FBI master briefing deck with "Prominent Names" page | **Page 17: Every redacted name on the Prominent Names list.** ⚠ **OCR accuracy warning:** The following names were extracted from garbled OCR text layers in scanned documents. OCR text frequently contains errors, misreadings, and artifacts from the scanning process. These fragments are *unverified* and may be incorrect: Trump, Weinstein, Prince Andrew, Jes Staley, Leon Black, Glenn Dubin, Les Wexner, Dershowitz, Clinton, Howard Lutnick, William Barr — each with partial allegation fragments that may also contain OCR errors. **The unredacted version will confirm or correct ALL of these identifications and may contain additional names we couldn't recover.** This is precisely why viewing the originals matters. |
| 2 | **[EFTA01660651](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01660651.pdf)** | 6 | NTOC tips compilation (16+ tips) | **Every redacted tipster and subject name.** Key tip: Three brothers "Allen, Oren, Tal" (now confirmed as Alexander brothers, currently on trial SDNY for trafficking 60+ women) raped girls at Epstein's parties — 14-year-old "Katie LNU" still unidentified. Also contains Trump/Clinton/Victoria's Secret model allegations. FBI conducted ZERO follow-up on the Alexander tip. |
| 3 | **[EFTA01660679](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01660679.pdf)** | ~16 | Second NTOC tips compilation | **All redacted names across 16+ tips.** Overlaps with [EFTA01660651](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01660651.pdf) but contains additional tips. |

## APPENDIX A: THE "CHILLING EMAIL" — EFTA UNKNOWN

Per [media reports](https://wegotthiscovered.com/politics/doj-to-provide-congress-with-unredacted-epstein-files-after-criticism-about-protected-sender-of-chilling-email-referencing-your-littlest-girl/), DOJ was specifically criticized for redacting the sender of an email referencing "your littlest girl." The sender's identity was redacted. **This email is NOT in our databases** — it was either properly redacted (no hidden text layer) or exists in a form we couldn't extract. The phrase does not appear across 3.4M+ records. However, `LITTLESTJEFF@YAHOO.COM` IS confirmed as Epstein's registered email in his sex offender file ([EFTA00037421](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00037421.pdf)), and the FBI included `*littlestjeff*` in their keyword search list ([EFTA00027057](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00027057.pdf)). **This should be priority #1 if the EFTA number can be identified in the reading room.**

## APPENDIX A2: THE UNSEARCHED 2005 COMPUTER

**[EFTA00015823](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00015823.pdf)**: 16 EnCase forensic DVDs containing a complete image of Epstein's 2005 Palm Beach computer — from the PEAK ABUSE PERIOD when dozens of minors were being trafficked. The government stated it "did not intend to obtain a warrant." The estate refused a privilege waiver. **The forensic image on these DVDs has never been examined by federal authorities.** (Note: The Palm Beach County Sheriff's Office Computer Crimes Unit created the image and may have conducted local examination, possibly including for the 2006 grand jury — but the federal documents do not address this.) Congress can demand the federal warrant be obtained. This is arguably the single most important piece of unexamined evidence at the federal level.

## APPENDIX A3: THE MASSEUSE LIST

**[EFTA00024797](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00024797.pdf)**: 7 pages, ENTIRELY REDACTED. Found on seized devices. Per FBI, the names are "believed to be women and girls, some of which were identified minors" ([EFTA00038620](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00038620.pdf)). Was planned as a Maxwell trial exhibit but never used ([EFTA00038620](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00038620.pdf)). **Every name on this list should be visible in the unredacted version. This is the victim roster.**

## APPENDIX B: DOCUMENTS THE FBI NEVER FOLLOWED UP ON

These represent leads the FBI identified but never pursued:
1. **Alexander brothers** rape tip → ZERO follow-up ([EFTA01660651](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01660651.pdf))
2. **Austrian passport / Fortelni** → Agent wrote "I will call tomorrow," no record of call ([EFTA00021576](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00021576.pdf))
3. **Surveillance tip** of Epstein with young girl, late 2018 → "nothing was done" ([EFTA00020778](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00020778.pdf))
4. **Zorro Ranch video tip** → Treated as extortion ([EFTA00038382](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00038382.pdf))
5. **Richard Taus** (FBI SA) letter about death information → Processed as routine CCR, no follow-up ([EFTA00006036](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%204/EFTA00006036.pdf))
6. **4chan death leak** → Dynamic IP never identified ([EFTA00027732](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00027732.pdf))
7. **Oct 2020 device review** of 10 specific devices → NO results document exists anywhere
8. **Bannon-Epstein texts** → "Not responsive to our warrant," no separate warrant sought ([EFTA00027290](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00027290.pdf))

## APPENDIX C: KEY CORRECTIONS FROM OUR ANALYSIS

To avoid spreading misinformation, note these corrections from our verification:
1. ~~Flight logs were retroactively altered~~ → **FALSE.** Pilot Rodgers specifically would NOT go back to add names. Logs are INCOMPLETE, not tampered with.
2. ~~616,000 documents have hidden text behind black boxes~~ → **FALSE.** The "bad_overlay" database classification was OCR noise from image-based PDFs, not recoverable hidden text.
3. ~~December 19 "poorly redacted" files expose names~~ → **OVERSTATED.** Only 59 documents differed, only 8 had any text change, and most "exposed text" was garbled OCR. One victim letter ([EFTA00001932](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%201/EFTA00001932.pdf)) had genuinely readable fragments.
4. ~~Victim "database" tracking system confirmed by FBI~~ → **UNVERIFIED.** The "computerized database" claim originates from USVI civil lawsuit, not FBI evidence. The masseuse list IS real but fully redacted.

## APPENDIX D: WHAT IS NOT IN THESE FILES

Based on exhaustive search of 218GB across 6 databases (3.4M+ records):

**Israeli intelligence terms — CORRECTED (originally all reported as ZERO):**
- **Carbyne:** 50 documents (DS9) — complete investment structure ($1.5M invested, $50M valuation, board reports). See [ISRAEL_DEEP_DIVE_V2.md](intelligence/ISRAEL_DEEP_DIVE_V2.md).
- **Reporty:** 324 documents (DS9) — related to Carbyne/Barak investment.
- **Unit 8200:** 11 documents — news articles about the Israeli signals intelligence unit, circulated among Epstein's network. No direct operational connection documented.
- **Shin Bet:** 23 documents — appears in news/reference material. No direct operational connection documented.
- **Mega Group:** 4 documents — references exist but no substantive Epstein connection documented.
- **FBI CHS FD-1023** ([EFTA00090314](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00090314.pdf)): A confidential human source stated "Epstein belonged to both U.S. and allied intelligence services" and was "trained as a spy under" Barak. This is a single-source CHS report, not corroborated by other documents.
- **ZERO** mentions of: Ari Ben-Menashe, LAKAM (Israeli intelligence agency — apparent text matches are OCR noise)

**Conspiracy debunking — NO connection found:**
- **Gabriela Rico Jimenez:** ZERO mentions. The August 2009 Monterrey incident has no connection to Epstein.
- **Carlos Slim:** 48 incidental mentions (conferences, jokes, real estate) — ZERO substantive connection to Epstein operations.
- **Cannibalism:** 7 documents — one FBI 302 from a mentally unstable interviewee, no corroboration. Not a credible lead.

**Still unidentified:**
- "French hotel chain owner" — ZERO identification across all databases
- "Ms. Vicki," "Mr. Robert and Jill," "the Gregorys" — ZERO identification
- CBP officer (Badge CAS03223) — name redacted in every database (identified as Timothy Routch in DS9 unredacted documents, see [CBP_CORRUPTION_INVESTIGATION.md](institutional/CBP_CORRUPTION_INVESTIGATION.md))
- **Deripaska** connection (Mandelson Moscow email referencing "Oleg") — ZERO results for "Deripaska"
