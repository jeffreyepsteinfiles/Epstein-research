---

## METHODOLOGY

Each official's name was searched as an exact quoted phrase in the FTS5 full-text index of all 12 DOJ Epstein file datasets (218 GB total). For officials with significant hit counts, a deeper context analysis was performed — sampling 5-10 document snippets to categorize the nature of each mention.

**Categories:**
- **DIRECT** — Direct personal involvement: emails, meetings, financial ties, contact lists
- **INVESTIGATION** — Referenced in Epstein investigation/prosecution documents
- **POLITICAL** — Political/legislative context: oversight, public statements, policy
- **MIXED** — Multiple categories present across mentions
- **NEWS** — News clips or media references unrelated to Epstein
- **FALSE POSITIVE** — Name matches a different person entirely

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

- **46** appear in the corpus (7 with zero mentions)
- **2** with MIXED mention types (multiple categories)
- **2** in political/legislative context only
- **1** confirmed FALSE POSITIVES (different person with same name)
- **41** appear only in news coverage unrelated to Epstein
- **7** not found in any document

### Officials with Mixed Mentions

**Mitch McConnell** (U.S. Senate Kentucky) — 125 documents, 184 pages
> McConnell appears overwhelmingly in news digests and political coverage (Senate legislation, impeachment, COVID relief, etc.). However, one notable document ([EFTA02510782](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02510782.pdf)) shows an email between Epstein and his associate Erika Kellerhals with the subject line 'Re: Mitch McConnell,' where Kellerhals asks Epstein 'Do you want to make a donation?' and Epstein replies 'no.' This indicates Epstein was at least presented with the opportunity to donate to McConnell but declined. No evidence of personal contact between McConnell and Epstein.
> Key documents: [EFTA02510782](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02510782.pdf)

**Rick Scott** (U.S. Senate Florida) — 52 documents, 61 pages
> Rick Scott appears primarily in news digests (Medicaid expansion, Florida politics, TikTok legislation, immigration). His name also appears on a Florida dental license issued to Karyna Shuliak (Epstein's girlfriend) in his capacity as Governor of Florida -- this is a routine government document, not a personal connection. Two documents show news articles about Epstein's jet appearing alongside a separate headline about Scott's gubernatorial race, which are adjacent news items, not a connection. One LinkedIn update references 'Gov. Rick Scott' in the context of a drug-testing law adjacent to Epstein's connection notifications. No personal contact or substantive connection to Epstein.
> Key documents: [EFTA00520947](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00520947.pdf), [EFTA02033276](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA02033276.pdf)

### Officials in Political/Legislative Context

**Marsha Blackburn** (U.S. Senate Tennessee) — 59 documents, 69 pages
> Blackburn appears in the corpus in two distinct contexts: (1) general news/political coverage (COVID response, monetary policy), and (2) her active push for release of the Epstein files. Multiple 2025 documents show Blackburn formally requesting unredacted Epstein files from FBI Director Kash Patel and publicly calling for transparency in the Epstein investigation. Additionally, several letters from a third-party tipster/complainant repeatedly urge authorities to contact Senator Blackburn about financial fraud allegations tangentially connected to Epstein matters. No personal connection to Epstein; her involvement is investigatory/legislative.

**Josh Hawley** (U.S. Senate Missouri) — 45 documents, 64 pages
> Hawley appears in news coverage of his Senate activities (COVID relief, cybersecurity, TikTok) and, notably, in 2025 news coverage calling for transparency and release of the Epstein files. Multiple documents from 2025 show Hawley joining other GOP senators in demanding Epstein file disclosure. One document records a criminal threat made against Hawley that the FBI investigated. No personal connection to Epstein.

### Confirmed False Positives

**Jim Justice** (U.S. Senate West Virginia) — 45 documents
> The vast majority of 'Jim Justice' hits refer to the West Virginia politician (Governor, now Senator) in news coverage. However, a significant portion of the high hit count comes from a single prolific tipster/complainant who repeatedly writes about financial fraud schemes, mentioning 'Jim Justice' in connection with Greensill Capital, Credit Suisse, Milken, and securitization fraud -- these are allegations about Justice's business dealings in a broader financial fraud context, not related to the Epstein sex trafficking case. The 'Jim Justice' matches in this corpus are not related to Epstein's personal network or trafficking operation.

*This report was generated by searching the complete DOJ Epstein file corpus (12 datasets, 218 GB). The presence of an official's name in this corpus does not imply any wrongdoing or connection to Jeffrey Epstein — the vast majority of mentions are in news articles, political coverage, and other media collected as part of the investigation. Only entries marked DIRECT indicate documented personal contact.*
