## METHODOLOGY

Each official's name was searched as an exact quoted phrase in the FTS5 full-text index of all 12 DOJ Epstein file datasets (218 GB total). For officials with significant hit counts, a deeper context analysis was performed — sampling 5-10 document snippets to categorize the nature of each mention.

**Categories:**
- **DIRECT** — Direct personal involvement: emails, meetings, financial ties, contact lists
- **INVESTIGATION** — Referenced in Epstein investigation/prosecution documents
- **POLITICAL** — Political/legislative context: oversight, public statements, policy
- **MIXED** — Multiple categories present across mentions
- **NEWS** — News clips or media references unrelated to Epstein
- **FALSE POSITIVE** — Name matches a different person entirely

*This report was generated by searching the complete DOJ Epstein file corpus (12 datasets, 218 GB). The presence of an official's name in this corpus does not imply any wrongdoing or connection to Jeffrey Epstein — the vast majority of mentions are in news articles, political coverage, and other media collected as part of the investigation. Only entries marked DIRECT indicate documented personal contact.*
