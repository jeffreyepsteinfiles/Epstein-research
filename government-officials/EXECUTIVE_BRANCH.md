### Joe Biden
**Role:** Former President
**Documents:** 392 | **Category:** NEWS

Overwhelmingly news coverage of Biden's presidential campaign, transition, and presidency. Appears in COVID response coverage, election certification context, transition team reporting, and general policy news. One mention on a magician's 'yeses from politicians not yet scheduled' list that includes 'Vice President Biden' ([EFTA00839333](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00839333.pdf)) - this is a magician pitching Epstein to arrange a performance for Biden, not direct Biden-Epstein contact. No direct personal connection to Epstein found.

- **NEWS**: Presidential campaign and policy coverage ([EFTA01658289](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01658289.pdf), [EFTA00137183](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00137183.pdf), [EFTA00160334](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00160334.pdf)); transition coverage ([EFTA00137440](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00137440.pdf)); COVID response ([EFTA00135867](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00135867.pdf)); election certification ([EFTA00160334](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00160334.pdf)); trade policy ([EFTA00145723](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00145723.pdf))
- **INVESTIGATION**: Christopher Wray testimony denying political interference in Hunter Biden probe ([EFTA00160591](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00160591.pdf))
- **DIRECT**: Listed as prospective magician performance target on list sent to Epstein ([EFTA00839333](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00839333.pdf)) - tangential, shows Biden was someone the magician wanted to perform for and was pitching through Epstein's network

Sample documents: [EFTA00839333](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00839333.pdf), [EFTA01658289](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01658289.pdf), [EFTA00137183](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00137183.pdf), [EFTA00160591](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00160591.pdf)

*Note: The magician list ([EFTA00839333](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00839333.pdf)) shows Biden as a desired future performance target, not a confirmed interaction. This is a magician using Epstein to try to book political performances.*

*Note: The 'susan rice fun' comment in context of an email chain with Kathy Ruemmler (who was both Obama's WH Counsel and later Epstein's lawyer) suggests social familiarity, potentially through Ruemmler's dual connections. The charitable fund listing is a JP Morgan/Gates Foundation document, not an Epstein-organized event.*

### William Burns
**Role:** Former CIA Director
**Documents:** 20 | **Category:** DIRECT

KEY FINDING: William Burns (former Deputy Secretary of State, later CIA Director under Biden) had direct personal contact with Epstein facilitated by Epstein's network. Epstein emailed Peter Thiel introducing Burns: 'Bill (William Burns), under sec of state... best and most respected diplomat in the admin, you should meet him, he conducted the secret iran negotiations... I can set up when you are avail' ([EFTA02587069](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02587069.pdf), [EFTA02370150](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02370150.pdf)). Peter Thiel then emailed Burns directly with Epstein CC'd ([EFTA02339235](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02339235.pdf)). Burns and Epstein exchanged scheduling emails about meeting in NYC and Florida ([EFTA02592203](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02592203.pdf), [EFTA01748726](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01748726.pdf), [EFTA00869068](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00869068.pdf), [EFTA01001666](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA01001666.pdf)). Burns discussed his State Department departure and vacation plans with Epstein. This shows Epstein positioned himself as a connector between Burns and Thiel, and maintained a personal relationship with Burns in 2014.

- **DIRECT**: Epstein introduced Burns to Peter Thiel via email ([EFTA02587069](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02587069.pdf), [EFTA02370150](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02370150.pdf)); Thiel emailed Burns with Epstein CC'd ([EFTA02339235](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02339235.pdf)); scheduling meetings with Epstein in NYC/Florida ([EFTA02592203](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02592203.pdf), [EFTA01748726](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01748726.pdf)); discussing vacation plans ([EFTA00869068](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00869068.pdf)); Epstein mentioning 'bill gates in on the 5th' to Burns around Thanksgiving ([EFTA01001666](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA01001666.pdf))
- **NEWS**: CIA Director Burns in congressional testimony ([EFTA00148318](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00148318.pdf)); Jordan letter to Burns about 51 intelligence signers ([EFTA00163736](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00163736.pdf)); secret Iran negotiations coverage ([EFTA01931873](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01931873.pdf))
- **POLITICAL**: Obama-era intelligence handling ([EFTA01655462](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01655462.pdf))

Sample documents: [EFTA02587069](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02587069.pdf), [EFTA02370150](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02370150.pdf), [EFTA02339235](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02339235.pdf), [EFTA02592203](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02592203.pdf), [EFTA01001666](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA01001666.pdf)

*Note: Burns' interactions with Epstein occurred in 2014, as Burns was leaving the State Department. Epstein actively brokered a connection between Burns and Peter Thiel. This is a significant finding - the future CIA Director had direct social contact with Epstein post-conviction.*

### Samantha Power
**Role:** Former USAID
**Documents:** 17 | **Category:** MIXED

Mentions include (1) Power listed on a magician's prospective performance list sent to Epstein as 'UN representative Samantha Power' under 'yeses from politicians not yet scheduled' ([EFTA00839333](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00839333.pdf)), (2) foreign policy news about her as UN Ambassador and USAID nominee, and (3) unmasking controversy. The magician list shows Epstein was used as a networking conduit to reach high-profile political figures.

- **DIRECT**: Listed on magician's 'yeses from politicians not yet scheduled' list sent to Epstein ([EFTA00839333](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00839333.pdf)) - shows Epstein network used to access political figures

- **POLITICAL**: Unmasking controversy ([EFTA00149562](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00149562.pdf), [EFTA00150682](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00150682.pdf))

Sample documents: [EFTA00839333](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00839333.pdf), [EFTA00872448](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00872448.pdf), [EFTA01964297](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01964297.pdf)

*Note: Like Biden, Power appears on the magician's wish list - this shows the magician was using Epstein's connections to try to book performances for political figures, not that Power had direct contact with Epstein.*
