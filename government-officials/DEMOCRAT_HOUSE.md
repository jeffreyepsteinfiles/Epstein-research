# Democratic House Members in the Epstein Files
## Full-Corpus Search Results for All 216 Democratic U.S. House Members (119th Congress)
*Generated 2026-02-12 from full_text_corpus.db (1,380,937 documents, 2,731,796 pages across 12 DOJ datasets)*

---

## METHODOLOGY

Each official's name was searched as an exact quoted phrase in the FTS5 full-text index of all 12 DOJ Epstein file datasets (218 GB total). For officials with significant hit counts, a deeper context analysis was performed — sampling 5-10 document snippets to categorize the nature of each mention.

**Categories:**
- **DIRECT** — Direct personal involvement: emails, meetings, financial ties, contact lists
- **INVESTIGATION** — Referenced in Epstein investigation/prosecution documents
- **POLITICAL** — Political/legislative context: oversight, public statements, policy
- **MIXED** — Multiple categories present across mentions
- **NEWS** — News clips or media references unrelated to Epstein
- **FALSE POSITIVE** — Name matches a different person entirely

### Officials with Direct Connections

**Stacey Plaskett** (U.S. House Virgin Islands At-large District) — 165 documents, 180 pages
> Plaskett (USVI Delegate) had a direct, documented personal and financial relationship with Jeffrey Epstein. Epstein's calendar shows scheduled meetings with Plaskett at his USVI compound (STC/Little St. James), his staff coordinated fundraising contributions to her congressional campaigns ('Plaskett for Congress'), Epstein personally called her on her cell phone, and she was introduced to Epstein through attorney Erika Kellerhals. The documents include emails between Epstein's assistants and Plaskett arranging meetings from 2014 through 2018.

**Diana DeGette** (U.S. House Colorado District 1) — 48 documents, 55 pages
> DeGette (D-CO) had a documented fundraising relationship with Epstein. Multiple documents show a woman named Barbro (a mutual contact) introducing DeGette to Epstein, arranging meetings, and coordinating fundraisers for DeGette's congressional campaign hosted in New York City. Epstein was directly involved in organizing and contributing to DeGette's fundraising events, with communications from 2013-2014. DeGette's focus on stem cell research and science policy was cited as the basis for the introduction.

### Officials with Mixed Mentions

**Steve Cohen** (U.S. House Tennessee District 9) — 120 documents, 123 pages
> The name 'Steve Cohen' matches TWO distinct individuals in this corpus. (1) Steven A. Cohen, the hedge fund billionaire (SAC Capital/Point72), appears in Epstein's personal communications about real estate dealings, financial news, and social connections -- Epstein discussed Cohen's prosecution for insider trading, Cohen's real estate listings, and potential employees from Cohen's fund. (2) Rep. Steve Cohen (D-TN), the congressman, appears in a DOJ OIG response letter about the Epstein plea deal investigation ([EFTA00811997](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00811997.pdf)) and is referenced by Epstein victims/advocates as a congressman who pushed FBI Director Wray for accountability on Epstein evidence. The hedge fund Cohen has direct Epstein connections; the congressman's involvement is in the INVESTIGATION category.
> Key documents: [EFTA01976853](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01976853.pdf), [EFTA00708577](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00708577.pdf), [EFTA02573553](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02573553.pdf), [EFTA00715767](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00715767.pdf), [EFTA00811997](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00811997.pdf)

**Steny Hoyer** (U.S. House Maryland District 5) — 32 documents, 37 pages
> Hoyer appears primarily in news coverage (Congressional ceremonies, legislative debates, AOC confrontation). However, he is specifically mentioned in a direct email exchange between Epstein and Kathy Ruemmler (former White House Counsel), where Ruemmler says 'George Mitchell got this award too. And Steny Hoyer' -- referencing an award that both received ([EFTA02446424](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02446424.pdf)). This email is part of Epstein's communication with Ruemmler, suggesting Hoyer was known to Epstein's circle at least by name in the context of an award/honor. Separately, multiple documents from Ehud Barak's U.S. visits (forwarded within Epstein's email system) note Barak's meetings with 'Democratic whip Steny Hoyer,' placing Hoyer's name in Epstein's Barak-related correspondence. No direct personal contact between Hoyer and Epstein is documented.

### Officials in Investigation Context

**Jamie Raskin** (U.S. House Maryland District 8) — 26 documents, 30 pages
> Raskin appears in the corpus in two contexts: (1) political/news coverage (25th Amendment proposal, Judiciary Committee activities, DOJ oversight), and (2) direct involvement in the Epstein investigation as a signatory to congressional letters demanding accountability. He co-signed a letter to Attorney General William Barr demanding investigation into Epstein's death and the DOJ's handling of the case ([EFTA00175131](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00175131.pdf), [EFTA00175178](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00175178.pdf)). He also appears in documents about a secular conference where he spoke alongside Lawrence Krauss (who was later connected to Epstein).
> Key documents: [EFTA00175131](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00175131.pdf), [EFTA00175178](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00175178.pdf), [EFTA02519207](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02519207.pdf), [EFTA02522653](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02522653.pdf)

### Confirmed False Positives

**George Whitesides** (U.S. House California District 27) — 52 documents
> This is NOT the congressman George Whitesides (D-CA, elected 2024). The George Whitesides in these documents is Professor George M. Whitesides, the renowned Harvard biochemist. Epstein had a direct relationship with this scientist, arranging meetings through Boris Nikolic (a mutual connection) and scheduling in-person sessions at ISF (Institute for Scientific Frontiers). The documents show Epstein was introduced to Whitesides by Boris Nikolic, met with him multiple times between 2009-2012, and included him on lists of prominent scientists. The congressman George Whitesides (who previously led Virgin Galactic and was NASA Chief of Staff) is a completely different person.

*This report was generated by searching the complete DOJ Epstein file corpus (12 datasets, 218 GB). The presence of an official's name in this corpus does not imply any wrongdoing or connection to Jeffrey Epstein — the vast majority of mentions are in news articles, political coverage, and other media collected as part of the investigation. Only entries marked DIRECT indicate documented personal contact.*
