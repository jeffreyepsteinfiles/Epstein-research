# Dataset 10 - Interim Redaction Analysis Findings

> **Note:** This is a historical interim snapshot generated at ~15% scan completion. It has been fully superseded by DS10_COMPLETE_FINDINGS.md, which documents the complete scan results. All findings below (trust beneficiary names, victim interview transcripts, plea deal negotiations, financial records) are documented more completely in the final report. Additionally, per REDACTION_TEXT_LAYER_ANALYSIS (Report #93), the "hidden text" referenced throughout this report is predominantly garbled OCR from an invisible Tr=3 text rendering layer placed over scanned images — not content deliberately concealed beneath PDF redaction annotations. While the identified content is real and has been verified, the data provenance is OCR extraction, not redaction-defeat.

**Generated:** 2026-02-05 (scan in progress)
**Status:** ~15% scanned (77K of 503,154 PDFs), scan ETA ~1 hour
**Database:** Dataset 10 document text database

## Scale Comparison

| Metric | DS1-9,11-12 (all combined) | DS10 (15% scanned) |
|--------|---------------------------|---------------------|
| PDFs scanned | 16,284 | 77,000 |
| Total redactions | 179,139 | 268,110 |
| Bad overlays (recoverable text) | 70,940 | 91,646 |
| Proper redactions | 108,199 | 176,464 |
| Documents with hidden text | 9,133 | 22,398 |

**DS10 is the largest and most document-rich dataset by a factor of 30x.** At only 15% scanned, it already contains more recoverable hidden text than all other datasets combined.

## Projected Final Numbers

At the current density rate (~1.19 bad overlays per PDF on average), the full DS10 scan will likely yield:
- **~600,000+ total redaction regions**
- **~200,000+ bad overlays with recoverable text**
- **~140,000+ documents with hidden text**

This would mean DS10 alone contains approximately **3x more recoverable hidden text** than all other datasets combined.

## Categories of Hidden Information (from 77K docs scanned)

| Category | Document Count |
|----------|---------------|
| Financial/Banking | ~640 |
| Trust/Estate | ~146 |
| Law Enforcement | ~38 |
| Legal/Court | ~142 |
| Property/Real Estate | ~75 |
| Communications | ~385 |
| Victim/Abuse | ~27 |
| Named Associates | ~233 |

## Next Steps

1. Complete full DS10 scan (ETA ~1 hour from report generation)
2. Extract all hidden text from DS10 for systematic review
3. Cross-reference DS10 names with knowledge graph
4. Search for additional powerful names that may emerge in remaining 85% of documents
5. Update HIDDEN_TEXT_COMPLETE_REVIEW.md with DS10 findings
