## 2. Angara Trust ([EFTA00016084](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00016084.pdf))

**CLAIM**: [EFTA00016084](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00016084.pdf) shows Maxwell's irrevocable trust.

**VERIFIED: YES**

**Source Document**: DOJ dataset file `dataset8/VOL00008/IMAGES/0002/EFTA00016084.pdf`

**Full Document**: 32 pages ([EFTA00016084](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00016084.pdf) through [EFTA00016115](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00016115.pdf))

This is a UBS Client Relationship Agreement / Signature Page Summary for the Angara Trust, package ID 0186545016, Bates-stamped SDNY_GM_02742237.

**Page 1** - Signature Page Summary:
- Reference: V0109LOSVS98
- Account details: de 0104 1386 2771, dated 11/07/2016
- **Trust Name**: Angara Trust
- 6 accounts listed, all "RMA Domestic - Trust"

**Page 3 (Key Page)** - Client Information:
- **Trust Type**: Irrevocable Trust
- **Trust Name**: Angara Trust
- **Jurisdiction**: US Trust
- **Date Established**: 09/15/2016
- **Name of All Grantors**: Ghislaine Maxwell
- **Name of All Trustees**: [REDACTED - black boxes visible in rendered image]
- **City, State, Zip Code**: Boston, MA 02210-2698
- Net Worth, Annual Income, Liquid Assets: ALL REDACTED
- Investment profile: "Aggressive" risk profile
- Objective: "Produce a Combination of Income and Capital Appreciation"

**Pages 5-32**: Entirely blank or containing only EFTA numbers (pages consisted of fully redacted content or blank pages in the agreement package).

**Analysis**: The trust was established September 15, 2016, with Maxwell as sole grantor, filed through UBS in Boston. The trustee names are fully redacted even in the underlying text layer. The trust post-dates Epstein's 2008 plea deal but precedes any federal charges against Maxwell. The Boston address (02210-2698 / 02114) matches addresses later found in the [EFTA00038329](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00038329.pdf) background report, where Maxwell was linked to the Boston area from 2018 onward.

## 3. Section 1512 Negotiations ([EFTA00019119](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00019119.pdf))

**CLAIM**: [EFTA00019119](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00019119.pdf) contains prosecutor-defense attorney exchanges about witness tampering.

**VERIFIED: YES**

**Source Document**: DOJ dataset file `dataset8/VOL00008/IMAGES/0003/EFTA00019119.pdf`

**Full Document**: 7 pages ([EFTA00019119](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00019119.pdf) through [EFTA00019125](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00019125.pdf))

This is a complete email chain between prosecutors (Kathleen E. Cassidy, USANYS; Samidh Guha) and defense attorneys (Susan Necheles; unnamed others whose names are redacted), spanning September 3 through November 9, 2020.

**Chronological reconstruction**:

1. **Sep 3, 2020**: Prosecution sends defense "two cases that bear directly on the question you raised regarding Section 1512(b)(3)" ahead of a scheduled call.

2. **Sep 11, 2020**: Prosecution follows up on defense questions about 18 U.S.C. Section 1510, explaining their legal position:
   - Section 1510 requires proof defendant knew the person was a federal law enforcement official (citing *United States v. Escalera*, 957 F.3d 122 (2d Cir. 2020))
   - Section 1512(b)(3) has NO such requirement
   - This is a significant legal distinction that would have been relevant to Maxwell's defense

3. **Sep 17-23, 2020**: Scheduling calls to discuss further.

4. **Oct 19, 2020**: Defense follows up asking for a check-in call.

5. **Oct 26, 2020**: Defense again requesting update on discussions.

6. **Oct 28, 2020**: Prosecution says they are "working on drafting something up."

7. **Nov 5, 2020** (PAGE 3 - CRITICAL): Prosecution sends defense a **"preliminary statement of facts"** for discussion:
   > "Following up on our discussions, we wanted to send you a preliminary statement of facts, so that we can discuss whether there might be room for agreement."

   Key qualifier:
   > "As we've discussed, this isn't a plea offer, and we don't intend to issue a plea offer before notifying and consulting with victims."

   The actual statement of facts is NOT included in the emails -- it was apparently sent as an attachment or separate communication.

8. **Nov 9, 2020**: Final scheduling for a Wednesday call.

**Analysis**: This confirms active Section 1512 (witness tampering) negotiations between the Maxwell prosecution team and her defense attorneys Susan Necheles and others. The prosecution was exploring whether a resolution was possible involving a factual admission related to witness tampering/obstruction charges. They explicitly noted this was NOT a formal plea offer. The legal discussion about Section 1510 vs. 1512(b)(3) suggests the defense was trying to argue for the higher-burden statute.

**Subsequent identification**: Plea language in [EFTA00089268](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00089268.pdf) describes the co-conspirator as having "scheduled hundreds of sexual massages with minors," which matches the role attributed to Sarah Kellen Vickers in other case documents. Kellen Vickers is the most likely Section 1512 co-conspirator referenced in these negotiations.

## 4. Flight Log Boeing 727 ([EFTA00030271](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00030271.pdf) and [EFTA00019442](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00019442.pdf))

**CLAIM**: These documents reference Epstein's Boeing 727 flight logs.

**VERIFIED: YES**

### [EFTA00030271](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00030271.pdf)
**Source**: DOJ dataset file `dataset8/VOL00008/IMAGES/0007/EFTA00030271.pdf`

**Document Type**: Internal SDNY email from an Assistant United States Attorney to FBI New York, dated June 11, 2019.

**Subject**: "Phone/flight records"

**Contents**: An email containing a table cross-referencing phone calls with flight arrivals on 9/16/2004:
- 9/16/2004, 1:49 PM - Call (2 minutes) [names/numbers redacted with orange highlighting]
- 9/16/2004, 2:08 PM - Call (1 minute)
- 9/16/2004, 6:45 PM - Call (1 minute)
- **9/16/2004, 10:16 PM - "Epstein's Flight arrives at PBIA (Boeing 727)"** - with passenger "Jeffrey Epstein, [redacted]"

PBIA = Palm Beach International Airport. This shows prosecutors were mapping phone calls to Epstein's flight arrivals on the Boeing 727.

### [EFTA00019442](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00019442.pdf)
**Source**: DOJ dataset file `dataset8/VOL00008/IMAGES/0003/EFTA00019442.pdf`

**Document Type**: Actual flight manifest (2 pages), scanned images.

**Page 1**: Cover page of a flight log book, handwritten:
- "727 Boeing - N908JE"
- "JEGE, Inc."
- Bates number: MM11-727 BOEING-N908JE_JEGE INC-000001
- The remainder is completely blacked out (original redaction, not digital overlay).

**Page 2**: A passenger manifest form:
- Company: JEGE, Inc.
- Aircraft Registration: N908JE, Type: B-727-31
- **Date**: 1/12/2004
- **From**: PBI (Palm Beach), Departure 6:15 AM
- **To**: JFK (New York), Arrival 8:23 AM
- **Trip Number**: 241
- **Passenger 1**: Jeffrey Epstein (passenger 2+ heavily redacted with black)
- **Origin**: West Palm Beach, FL
- **Destination**: New York, NY
- Nautical Miles: 893 / Statute Miles: 1027
- Gallons: 3045, Pounds: 18552
- Flight Time: 2:07
- Altitude FL: FL370/FL510

**Analysis**: N908JE was the registration number for Epstein's Boeing 727-31, owned through JEGE, Inc. The manifests confirm the aircraft type and ownership. The second passenger(s) are fully redacted with original black marker, not digital redaction.

## 5. "Sexually Suggestive Photographs of Underage Girls" ([EFTA00024584](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00024584.pdf))

**CLAIM**: This document is a government filing referencing sexually suggestive photographs of underage girls.

**VERIFIED: YES - with precision correction**

**Source Document**: DOJ dataset file `dataset8/VOL00008/IMAGES/0005/EFTA00024584.pdf`

**Full Document**: 10 pages ([EFTA00024584](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00024584.pdf) through [EFTA00024593](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00024593.pdf))

This is the **Government's Detention Memorandum** in *United States v. Jeffrey Epstein, 19 Cr. 490 (RMB)*, filed July 8, 2019, addressed to the Honorable Henry Pitman, U.S. Magistrate Judge, SDNY.

**The exact quote (Page 9, [EFTA00024592](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00024592.pdf))**:
> "the defendant has continued to maintain a vast trove of lewd photographs of young-looking women or girls in his Manhattan mansion. In a search of the New York Residence on the night of his arrest, on July 6-7, 2019, pursuant to judicially-authorized warrants, law enforcement officers discovered... at least hundreds -- and perhaps thousands -- of **sexually suggestive photographs of fully- or partially-nude females**. While these items were only seized this weekend and are still being reviewed, some of the nude or partially-nude photographs **appear to be of underage girls**, including at least one girl who, according to her counsel, was underage at the time the relevant photographs were taken."

**Additional critical detail**:
> "some of the photographs referenced herein were discovered in a locked safe, in which law enforcement officers also found **compact discs with hand-written labels** including the following: **'Young [Name] + [Name],' 'Misc nudes 1,' and 'Girl pics nude.'**"

**Precision correction**: The claim as stated ("sexually suggestive photographs of underage girls") conflates two separate phrases from the document. The actual text says "sexually suggestive photographs of fully- or partially-nude females" and separately notes some "appear to be of underage girls." The combined meaning is essentially the same, but the exact phrasing is more nuanced in the source.

The filing also details:
- Charges: sex trafficking of minors (18 U.S.C. 1591) and conspiracy
- Victims as young as 14 years old
- 6 residences including a private island in USVI
- $77 million Manhattan mansion
- Two private jets, one capable of intercontinental travel
- 20+ international flights in prior 18 months
- Three active US passports
- Prior Florida investigation and NPA (non-prosecution agreement)
- Registered Level 3 sex offender in New York ("high" risk)
- Prior allegations of witness tampering, including private investigators who "forced off the road" a victim's father

## 9. Cross-Reference: [EFTA00016338](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00016338.pdf)-16341 (Completely Redacted/Missing Files)

**CLAIM**: Four consecutive EFTA files (16338-16341) were completely redacted.

**VERIFIED: CLARIFIED - These are "Native Placeholder" files, not redacted content**

**Findings**:

The four files each contain exactly one page with the text:
```
Native Placeholder
No Images Produced
EFTA000163XX
```

This means these EFTA numbers reference **native electronic files** (spreadsheets, databases, email attachments, etc.) that were not converted to images for the production. They were not "redacted" -- they simply were never imaged.

**Database cross-reference**:
- These four files have **0 total redactions** and **0 bad redactions** in the document_summary table
- NO documents in the entire database reference these EFTA numbers in their hidden text
- The initial search for "16338" etc. returned results, but those were false positives -- they matched other EFTA numbers that happened to contain those digit sequences (e.g., [EFTA01633816](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01633816.pdf) in [EFTA01633770](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01633770.pdf)'s pagination)

**Surrounding context**:
- [EFTA00016342](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00016342.pdf): Contains email about "Amazon Ref No" and "Subpoena 20 Mag 6216"
- [EFTA00016343](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00016343.pdf): Contains email about "Maxwell's Credit" dated "Monday, June 22"
- [EFTA00016344](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00016344.pdf)-16345: Additional documents with redactions

The four "placeholder" files were likely Excel spreadsheets, CSV files, or other native electronic records related to Maxwell's financial records (given the surrounding documents discuss Amazon subpoenas and credit records). The original files may have been produced in native format separately, or they may have been withheld entirely.

## 10. "Criminal Record: YES" on Maxwell's Firearms Application

**CLAIM**: Maxwell's 2006 NYPD firearms application shows "Criminal Record: YES."

**VERIFIED: YES -- RESOLVED as self-reported error**

The NYPD firearms application ([EFTA01653379](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01653379.pdf)) from February 21, 2006 clearly shows:
- **Criminal Record: YES**
- **Military Record: YES**
- **Status: APPROVED**

**Resolution via FBI Tactical Intelligence Report ([EFTA00174138](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA00174138.pdf))**:

A 10-page FBI Tactical Intelligence Report ran Maxwell through both the FBI's National Crime Information Center (NCIC) and NYPD databases. Both returned **no criminal record** for Maxwell. The December 2019 commercial background investigation report ([EFTA00038329](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00038329.pdf)) also shows:
- **Criminal Record: No**
- **Arrest Record: No**

**Conclusion**: The "Criminal Record: YES" on the 2006 firearms application was a self-reported error or data entry mistake, not an actual criminal history. Three independent checks (FBI NCIC, NYPD database, commercial background report) all found no criminal record.

**Remaining anomaly -- "Military Record: YES"**: Maxwell (born in France, 1961, holding UK/France/US citizenships) has no publicly known military service. French national service for women was abolished in 1970. No subsequent investigation has identified any Maxwell military service. This entry remains unexplained, and may reflect the same pattern of inaccurate self-reporting seen with the criminal record field.

**The firearms license was CANCELLED on 2009-11-16** because she "MOVED TO FLA." The gun (Glock 19, 9mm) was transferred via West Side Range.
