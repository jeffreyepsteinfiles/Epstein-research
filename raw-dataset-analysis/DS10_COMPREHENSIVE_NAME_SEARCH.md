# DS10 Comprehensive Name Search Report

## Database Overview

- **Database**: the Dataset 10 document text database
- **Total redaction records**: 1,629,776
- **Records with OCR text layers** (>3 chars): 434,721
- **Distinct documents scanned**: 209,829

**Methodology note:** The "hidden text" in this report is garbled OCR from invisible text rendering (Text Rendering Mode 3 at 96 DPI), not content concealed under removable redaction boxes. Black rectangles in DS10 PDFs are baked JPEG pixels, not PDF annotation overlays. The OCR text beneath them is an artifact of how scanned PDFs store text layers. These name counts are redaction-layer-only counts and significantly underestimate full-text presence; the full_text_corpus.db contains substantially higher counts for all names. See REDACTION_TEXT_LAYER_ANALYSIS.md for the definitive methodology analysis.

**NTOC caveat:** Many name mentions in this report come from NTOC (National Threat Operations Center) tips -- unverified, unvetted caller reports to tips.fbi.gov. These are raw intake, not FBI investigative conclusions or evidence of alleged conduct.

The guests were elder men and included Elon Musk. Don jr. Trump, Ivanka Trump, and Eric Trump were there. Attorney Allan Dershowitz was also there with Attorney Bob Shapiro."

**Note**: These are unverified tips from FBI hotlines. One complainant was "deemed not credible" with "3 separate incidents involving police which requested in mandatory psychiatric evaluations."

### Donald Trump (specific phrase: 16 mentions)
Same document cluster as above.

### Clinton (20 mentions)
**Best example** (from [EFTA01660651](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01660651.pdf).pdf, p.3):
> "Caller named other individuals involved in 'big orgy parties' with her, other young girls, and older Victoria's Secret models, including Bill Clinton and Donald Trump."

### Bill Clinton (12 mentions)

### Hillary Clinton (2 mentions)
Found in [EFTA01660679](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01660679.pdf).pdf (p.4), in the context of a tip about Trump and Epstein that also references Hillary Clinton, Lisa Marie Presley, and the British Royal Family.

### Obama (4 mentions)
Only fragmentary matches found: "Obamac" -- appears to be a partial/garbled OCR artifact. No substantive Epstein-related context.

### Biden (50 mentions)
**Best example** (from [EFTA01652749](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01652749.pdf).pdf, p.1 -- social media screenshot):
> "George B. Tonks: 'Joe Biden would frequently have hardcore sex at my DC office with my former business Partner Catalina Le storing, who is a member of the very powerful du Pont family.'"

This is captured social media from George B. Tonks, who was confirmed as a prolific online poster generating a **424-document** social media campaign across the FBI evidence. These are noise, not substantive intelligence. See GIUFFRE_THREATS_AND_4CHAN_ORIGINS.md for the Tonks identification.

### Bush (3 mentions)
No relevant Epstein connection. Matches are partial name overlaps (e.g., "Jamaal Bushara" in a KYC remediation email).

**Best example** (from [EFTA01660679](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01660679.pdf).pdf, p.1):
> "she was a pilates instructor and went to Epstein's once. Second time, called the royal family was contacting her about Image of Prince Andrews and Guiffre. Claimed she would send email to corroborate - no email received."

From the "Prominent Names" document: "[Victim told to] make Prince Andrew [do the] same things [as Epstein]..."

### Andrew (152 mentions)
High count due to common first name. Most are not Prince Andrew references; includes various people named Andrew in email headers. Note: "Andrew Cuomo" references in the corpus are an NTOC tip unrelated to the Prominent Names "Cuomo" entry, which is a victim surname (see Cuomo section below).

### Queen (7 mentions)

Also from the "Prominent Names" document: "Cuomo stated... [gave] massage and he made... made jokes about..."

**Correction: "Cuomo" on the Prominent Names page is a VICTIM SURNAME, not Governor Andrew Cuomo.** [EFTA02696360](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02696360.pdf) confirms "Tony Cuomo" invited to Epstein's NY house (Jan 2012).
