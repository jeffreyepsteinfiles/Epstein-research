# CBP CORRUPTION INVESTIGATION: EPSTEIN FILES DEEP DIVE

## Executive Summary

This report documents a systematic investigation into U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) corruption linked to Jeffrey Epstein's trafficking operation, drawn from forensic analysis of three databases containing redacted government documents, OCR-processed files, and text extracted from document text layers. The evidence reveals that at least one identified CBP officer stationed at St. Thomas, USVI knowingly assisted Epstein in bypassing normal customs processing for over seven years, that CBP travel records from 1990-2000 were never recorded in their database (creating a critical evidence gap), and that the FBI conducted a dedicated corruption investigation that included proffer sessions, FBI agent questioning, and coordination between multiple agencies.

## 1. THE CBP OFFICER: IDENTIFICATION AND SELF-INCRIMINATION

### [EFTA00031495](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00031495.pdf) -- CBP Supervisor's Report (August 30, 2019)

This is the single most damning document in the CBP corruption investigation. It is an internal CBP memo titled "INFORMATION PROVIDED BY CBPAS" dated Friday, August 30, 2019, at 0730 hours, from "1601 - CBP CES, Supervisor's office, North Charleston, SC."

**[IDENTITY DE-REDACTED 2026-02-12]:** The officer is **Timothy ("Tim") Routch**, also known as "Bill Routch" -- identified by name in DS9 unredacted versions ([EFTA00149603](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00149603.pdf), [EFTA00149608](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00149608.pdf)). FBI grand jury subpoenas for Routch's credit reports from all three bureaus (May/June 2020) confirm: employer DHS, position Agriculture Specialist ([EFTA01681786](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01681786.pdf), [EFTA01681789](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01681789.pdf), [EFTA01681829](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01681829.pdf)). Routch worked at USVI Pre-Clearance from 2008-2016, transferring to Charleston approximately February 21, 2016. The dual name "Bill"/"Tim" is explained by Lesley Groff having him in contacts as "Bill Routch, Customs Agent" while official documents use "Timothy."

The document records a CBP Agriculture Specialist (CBPAS), Badge # CAS03223, HashID # CZACMME, who walked into his supervisor's office to disclose that a female acquaintance had filed two complaints against him:

**ISSUE 1 -- Complaint to the U.S. Department of Justice:**
> "The female acquaintance of Mr. [REDACTED] has informed the Federal Department of Justice, that Mr. [REDACTED] is a known associate of Jeffery Epstein, had ongoing friendship with Mr. Epstein, and that while working for CBP Pre-Clearance in Saint Thomas for over 7 years, and assisted Mr. Epstein for conducting human trafficking of underage females."

When his supervisor asked how the female acquaintance could know about his associations in St. Thomas, the officer responded:

> **"Everyone knew I was friends with Jeffery Epstein."** He further stated: **"I have been to his house, been on his boat, and flew in helicopter for whale watching."**

The supervisor noted recalling "previous international travel history that has taken Mr. [REDACTED] locations for personal rendezvous excursions."

**ISSUE 2 -- Complaint to Charleston County Sheriff:**
The same female acquaintance filed a complaint accusing the officer of "predatory behavior, targeting widows, and vulnerable persons." The supervisor recalled "previous statements Mr. [REDACTED] has made, surrounding his previous rent landlord when first arriving to work with CBP Charleston; the landlord, an older female, with whom he ended up going to court."

**INFORMATIONAL HIGHLIGHTS:**
- The officer "appeared to be concerned, worried, and a bit shaken, about federal investigators looking into his past"
- The officer opened by saying the complainant was "the same acquaintance that attempted 'suicide' on a previous occasion"
- The officer "tried to keep CBP Supervisor [REDACTED] informed of contact made with outside investigators, because this interaction merits transparency for all future periodic re-investigations"

**SUMMARY from the supervisor's report:**
> "CBPAS [REDACTED], Charleston S.C., provided information connecting him to a convicted child molester while working for CBP; with accusations potentially ensnaring CBP's reputation as an agency, into the mix of a well known criminal, specifically the following:
> - While at the pre-clearance port of Saint Thomas, USVI (beginning in 2008), Mr. [REDACTED] palled around with Mr. Epstein, clearing his aircraft; and spending personal time with the convict after befriending him, entering into that friendship through carrying out CBP official duty.
> - Mr. [REDACTED] has had rocky relationships with previous single female as a landlord, upon arriving to work for CBP in Charleston, SC (transferring from Saint Thomas, USVI).
> - A separate female acquaintance attempted suicide, who is now informing [REDACTED] she has filed two (2) separate complaints with law enforcement, surrounding history of [REDACTED] behavior."

**Key facts established:**
- The officer was assigned to CBP Pre-Clearance at St. Thomas beginning in 2008
- He served there for over 7 years (approximately 2008-2015+)
- He later transferred to CBP in North Charleston, South Carolina
- He had a personal friendship with Epstein that began through his official CBP duties
- He admitted visiting Epstein's house, his boat, and flying in his helicopter
- His role included "clearing his aircraft" -- meaning he processed Epstein's plane through customs

## 2. THE PROFFER INVESTIGATION (October-November 2020)

### [EFTA00020852](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00020852.pdf) -- FBI/SDNY Proffer Sessions via WebEx

Multiple copies of this email chain appear across the databases (also in [EFTA00015006](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00015006.pdf), [EFTA00015013](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00015013.pdf), [EFTA00019203](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00019203.pdf), [EFTA00020825](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00020825.pdf), [EFTA00022435](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00022435.pdf), [EFTA00022456](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00022456.pdf), [EFTA00023258](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00023258.pdf), [EFTA00024932](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00024932.pdf), [EFTA00024938](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00024938.pdf)), indicating its significance.

**The Witness and His Counsel:**
**[IDENTITY DE-REDACTED 2026-02-12]:** The witness is **Larry Visoski**, Epstein's chief pilot (email: lvjet@aol.com). DS9 document [EFTA00081477](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00081477.pdf) names him in full: "We want Larry to be fully prepared." Visoski was represented by **Glen G. McGorty, Managing Partner of Crowell & Moring LLP, New York Office**. McGorty is a prominent white-collar defense attorney.

**The Prosecutors:**
The SDNY team included:
- An unnamed AUSA (lead prosecutor)
- Daniel Zelenko
- Danielle Giffuni
- An unnamed individual at USANYS

**Timeline of Proffer Sessions:**

1. **First Proffer Session** (approximately early October 2020): An initial interview was conducted. McGorty signed and returned the proffer agreement on or around October 5, 2020.

2. **October 9-26, 2020**: Scheduling emails for a second proffer session. The AUSA stated: "we would like to schedule time for a second interview with Mr. [REDACTED] via WebEx. Are there any days the week of November 9th when your team and Mr. [REDACTED] would be available? We would expect this proffer to be much shorter than our first, and certainly no more than two hours at most."

3. **Key Email -- October 26, 2020**: The AUSA specified the topics for the second proffer:
> "We expect to ask Mr. [REDACTED] about his interactions with [REDACTED], the U.S. Customs and Border Protection employee who worked in Saint Thomas and who had Mr. [REDACTED] listed as a contact in his phone. I expect we will ask for an approximate timeline of when Mr. [REDACTED] met and interacted with [REDACTED], the nature of those interactions, and any interactions [REDACTED] may have had with Epstein (to the best of Mr. [REDACTED]'s knowledge)."

   **[DE-REDACTED]:** DS9 [EFTA00081477](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00081477.pdf) provides the unredacted version: "We expect to ask Mr. Visoski about his interactions with Timothy ('Tim') Routch, the U.S. Customs and Border Protection employee who worked in Saint Thomas and who had Mr. Visoski listed as a contact in his phone."

4. **November 10-11, 2020**: McGorty asked for "more granularity on this topic" so his client could be "fully prepared."

5. **November 11, 2020**: The AUSA provided the detailed topics and announced FBI participation:
> "We will be joined by **two FBI agents who are focusing on the CBP topics** that we have previously discussed. I expect one of those agents will take the lead on questioning Mr. [REDACTED]. The topics we expect to cover include:
> - **The identities of any CBP employees Mr. [REDACTED] recalls interacting with Jeffrey Epstein in the Virgin Islands.**
> - **Any steps Mr. [REDACTED] recalls any CBP employees in the Virgin Islands taking to help Epstein and those traveling with Epstein to enter the country, including any steps that allowed Epstein or those traveling with him to avoid processing that travelers would normally undergo.**
> - **Any favors Mr. [REDACTED] recalls Epstein doing for CBP employees in the Virgin Islands, such as trips to Epstein's island.**"

6. **November 12, 2020**: Second proffer session held at 1pm via WebEx.

7. **November 17, 2020**: McGorty sent the executed proffer agreement from the second session, confirming it took place.

**Analysis:**
This proffer was specifically focused on CBP corruption. The FBI deployed two agents dedicated to "CBP topics." The questions reveal the government already knew:
- A specific CBP employee in St. Thomas had the witness as a contact in his phone
- CBP employees took steps to help Epstein avoid normal processing
- Epstein did favors for CBP employees, including trips to his island
- Multiple CBP employees may have been involved ("identities of any CBP employees")

The witness being proffered appears to be someone who was part of Epstein's inner circle (not the CBP officer himself, who was the subject of investigation), likely an employee or associate who witnessed CBP interactions firsthand.

## 3. THE C-4 CBP CASE (FBI Investigation)

### [EFTA00038585](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00038585.pdf) -- "C-4 CBP Case" Email (March 30, 2021)

This document reveals a **separate FBI investigation** (designated "C-4") specifically targeting the corrupt CBP officer:

> "After we interviewed Larry Visoski in November for our case, we have been trying to coordinate with our HSI partners to interview our subject, in an effort to close the loop on our case. We have finally set a date and are traveling to South Carolina next week to interview him. **(Our subject is a CBP employee who previously covered St. Thomas airport, and supposedly knew/socialized with Epstein)**"
>
> "Just in case, I wanted to check in with you to see if there was anything in particular that you would want me to ask our subject while we have him, if it helps you."

**Key revelations:**
- The FBI interviewed **Larry Visoski** (Epstein's chief pilot) in November (likely November 2020, concurrent with the proffer sessions)
- The FBI was coordinating with **HSI (Homeland Security Investigations)** partners
- The subject CBP employee had transferred to South Carolina (matching the North Charleston location in [EFTA00031495](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00031495.pdf))
- The investigation was active enough to warrant an in-person interview trip to South Carolina
- This was a separate case from the main Epstein/Maxwell prosecution, focused on the CBP angle

### [EFTA01305098](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01305098.pdf) -- FBI Document Referencing CBP

An FBI document (redacted content reveals): "nt-CBP and CBP Sup" and "ion was supervi" -- suggesting this is an FBI report documenting CBP supervision or supervisory-related corruption. The standard FBI disclaimer is present: "document contains neither recommendations nor conclusions of the FBI."

## 4. THE MISSING TRAVEL RECORDS (1990-2000)

### [EFTA00018023](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00018023.pdf) -- Critical Gap in TECS Database

This email chain between SDNY prosecutors and a CBP Task Force Officer assigned to SDNY reveals a devastating gap in border records:

> "As discussed, I reviewed all the travel records you sent. Unfortunately, **the outbound travel records were not recorded in CBP database during that time (between 1990-2000)** as they are today. In short, the TECS travel records you have for Maxwell and Epstein are all we have in CBP holdings so there's nothing further I can provide for that date range."

The CBP Task Force Officer also noted that for one individual (name redacted, likely a victim or associate), there were "two different name variations (with and without the space in her surname)" resulting in two separate TECS records. The officer consolidated these into an Excel spreadsheet.

### [EFTA00017999](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00017999.pdf) -- Additional Travel Records Request

> "Attached are the travel records as requested. However, it's the same issue as last time..since the outbound departures were not recorded during that timeframe it only shows the inbound arrivals."

### [EFTA00025075](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00025075.pdf) -- Confirmation of Data Gap

> "Yes that's correct I searched all name and documents. The inconsistent data is all pre-2000 when our agency did not track/record outbound departures."

### [EFTA00029610](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00029610.pdf) -- Correlating Travel with Victim Dates

The prosecutors asked the CBP TFO to cross-reference Maxwell and Epstein travel against specific dates related to a victim (likely a minor). The results for 1/1/1997 to 2/1/2000:

**Jeffrey Epstein INBOUND records:**
- 12/11/1999
- 1/21/2000

**Ghislaine Maxwell INBOUND records:**
- 6/23/1997
- 8/6/1997
- 7/20/1998
- 7/24/1998
- 12/18/1999
- 1/21/2000

The officer noted that between 6/23/1997 and 8/6/1997, Maxwell traveled OUTBOUND, and similarly between 7/20/1998 and 7/24/1998.

**Analysis:**
The absence of outbound travel records from 1990-2000 is catastrophic for the prosecution. This means:
- There is no CBP record of who Epstein and Maxwell took OUT of the country during the peak trafficking years
- Victims transported internationally cannot be traced through border records
- The only records available are inbound arrivals, meaning half the trafficking picture is missing
- This gap precisely covers the period when Epstein's operation was at its height and victims were being transported to and from the Virgin Islands, Europe, and other locations

### [EFTA00010069](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00010069.pdf) -- Extended Epstein TECS Records (6 pages)

Generated 04/22/2019, these records cover additional encounters through 2019, including his final travels before arrest. The records show regular patterns: Teterboro to St. Thomas to Palm Beach, with encounters at private aviation facilities rather than commercial terminals.

### [EFTA00010075](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00010075.pdf) -- Historical Epstein Records (1990s)

## 6. THE 2019 ARREST: CBP SILENT HIT OPERATION

### [EFTA00037716](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00037716.pdf) through [EFTA00037742](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00037742.pdf) -- Silent Hit Notifications

These documents reveal the FBI placed a **"silent hit"** notification on Epstein in the TECS system (Record: P3N06596100A01) linked to his passport (document: 566672615). This meant CBP would be alerted when Epstein crossed any border checkpoint, but the alert would NOT be displayed to the processing officer -- ensuring Epstein remained unaware he was being tracked.

**Timeline of Silent Hits (2019):**

| Date | Location | Type |
|------|----------|------|
| April 27, 2019 | KTEB (Teterboro) - Manifest query | ARRIVING, Flight N212JE |
| April 28, 2019 | CBP-TETERBORO, JET AVIATION | APP (Airport Primary) |
| May 5, 2019 | CBP-TETERBORO, JET AVIATION | APP |
| May 17, 2019 | KPBI (Palm Beach) - Manifest query | ARRIVING, Flight N212JE |
| May 18, 2019 | CBP-PALM BEACH, INTERNATIONAL | APP |
| June 2, 2019 | TIST (St. Thomas) - Manifest query | ARRIVING, Flight N212JE |
| June 9, 2019 | KTEB - Manifest query | ARRIVING, Flight N212JE |
| June 10, 2019 | KTEB - Manifest query | ARRIVING |
| June 11, 2019 | CBP-TETERBORO, JET AVIATION | APP (at primary) |
| June 14, 2019 | KTEB - Manifest query (x2) | DEPARTING, Flight N212JE |
| **July 5, 2019** | KTEB - Manifest query | **ARRIVING, Flight N212JE** |
| **July 6, 2019** | **CBP-TETERBORO, AIRPT HANGER 2** | **APP -- ARREST** |

The final hit on July 6, 2019 at Teterboro Airport, Hangar 2, was the trigger for Epstein's arrest.

### [EFTA00037313](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00037313.pdf), [EFTA00037368](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00037368.pdf), [EFTA00037984](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00037984.pdf), [EFTA00038053](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00038053.pdf), [EFTA00038089](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00038089.pdf), [EFTA00038100](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00038100.pdf) -- Arrest Operations Plans

Multiple versions of the FBI arrest operational plan document the CBP coordination:

> "Epstein is presently out of the country. A silent hit notification with CBP has been put into effect for his return to the US. Epstein's expected return to the US is unknown at this time. Hit notifications are received approximately 12 to 24 hours in advance. In the event that Epstein returns to Teterboro Airport, CBP will detain him at the airport. Agents and NYPD detectives will coordinate with FBI Newark and CBP, then respond to effect the arrest of Epstein."

The arrest was planned at **9 East 71st Street, New York** (Epstein's Manhattan townhouse) following CBP detention at Teterboro. The operation involved FBI, NYPD, and CBP coordination.

**Key detail from [EFTA00037313](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00037313.pdf):** The arrest plan specifies "Epstein is presently out of the country and scheduled to return to the US through Teterboro Airport at 5:20 PM on July 6, 2019." The vehicle used was a 2016 Black Chevrolet Suburban, license plate HCP5713.

**Flight tracked:** N212JE -- a Gulfstream registered to Plan D LLC, with Lawrence Visoski as manager and Jeffrey Epstein as member. The plane was flying from Paris, France to Teterboro, NJ.

## 7. POST-ARREST TECS QUERIES

### [EFTA00036977](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00036977.pdf) through [EFTA00036984](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00036984.pdf) -- Continued Monitoring

Even after Epstein's death (August 10, 2019), his TECS record continued to generate hits:

- **January 17, 2021** -- ICE-NEW YORK, SAC (ICE query)
- **February 16, 2021** -- ICE-ISLIP, HSI ASAC
- **March 6, 2020** -- ICE-VIENNA AU, HSI ATTACHE (international query from Vienna, Austria)
- **March 9, 2021** -- CBP-RESTON, NATL TARGETING CTR (multiple queries)
- **June 30, 2021** -- CBP-BUFFALO, PEACE BRIDGE
- **October 22, 2023** -- ICE-CHARLOTTE HSI

These continued queries, particularly from **ICE-Vienna** and **ICE-Charlotte HSI**, suggest ongoing international investigations or intelligence gathering related to the Epstein network even years after his death.

## 8. CBP TESTIMONY AND WITNESS COORDINATION

### [EFTA00010061](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00010061.pdf) -- CBP Testimony Request (November 2021)

For the Maxwell trial, the prosecution needed CBP testimony about their travel record systems:

> "I understand that you are in need of CBP assistance -- specifically testimony regarding our travel records prior to 2004. We have located an appropriate individual to testify and I would like to facilitate."

This came from a **Senior Attorney, Office of the Associate Chief Counsel, New York, U.S. Customs and Border Protection**, written to the SDNY prosecution team. The attachments included seven batches of SDNY_GM documents (CBP records used as exhibits).

### [EFTA00038950](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00038950.pdf) -- New CBP Witness (December 2021)

An email to **JUDKA, ALEXANDER L.** (alexander.l.judka@cbp.dhs.gov) at CBP requests identification of a "new CBP witness." The redacted content reveals a "Senior Attorney" at "OCC NE H[omepage]" -- the Office of Chief Counsel, Northeast, for CBP.

**Redacted content shows:** The exchange occurred December 14, 2021, with replies about "CBP witness" and "RE: CBP witness" -- suggesting the prosecution was lining up CBP witnesses for the Maxwell trial.

## 9. THE AIRPORT BOARDING INCIDENT

### [EFTA00007097](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%204/EFTA00007097.pdf) -- CBP Officers Board Epstein's Plane

This document describes a law enforcement operation at St. Thomas airport where a writer (likely a process server or investigator) attempted to serve target letters on two female targets believed to be on Epstein's plane:

> "Upon arriving at the airport's cargo entrance, this writer was met by [REDACTED] and two of his co-workers."

> "[REDACTED] advised they had the legal authority to board any aircraft going to the United States. I boarded the plane along with [REDACTED] and the other two CBP personnel."

> "The CBP officer returned and advised Epstein was alone and was still processing through customs."

**Analysis:** This incident shows CBP officers at St. Thomas airport had routine access to Epstein's aircraft and conducted customs checks. The cooperative relationship between CBP officers and the investigation/law enforcement is notable -- but it also shows these same officers had the ability to control who did and did not face scrutiny on Epstein's planes.

## 10. MAXWELL IMMIGRATION STATUS

### [EFTA00029688](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00029688.pdf) -- Maxwell's INS Notice of Action

Ghislaine Maxwell's immigration records reveal she was sponsored by Epstein for a work visa:

> **"Petition for a Nonimmigrant Worker"**
> Receipt: EAC-92-204-50733
> Petitioner: JEFFREY EPSTEIN, C/O JEFFREY EPSTEIN CHAIRMAN
> Beneficiary: MAXWELL, GHISLAINE, France
> Class: H1B
> Valid: 11/05/1992 to 11/04/1995
> Consulate: LONDON

This establishes that Epstein formally petitioned for Maxwell's H1B work visa in 1992, creating a legal dependency that facilitated her presence in the United States.

## 11. INFRASTRUCTURE: HOW VICTIMS ENTERED/EXITED USVI

### [EFTA00003150](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%201/EFTA00003150.pdf) -- Epstein's USVI Operations Structure

This document lists Epstein's operational infrastructure in St. Thomas:

**LSJE (Little St. James Estate) Employees:** Larry Visoski (pilot), Ann M. Rodriquez (Manager), Danny Vicars (Assistant Manager), Carlos Rodriquez, Ramon Linderman, Guy Vicars, Basillia Morales-Mercado, Carmen Rodgers, Reyna Amparo, Christopher Sheehan, Peter St. Omar, Dupson Donissaint, Gusneme Dalce, Onel Pierressaint, Gerry Francis, Hilian Bedminister, Sheridan Elizee, Cuthbert Titre.

**TWA Employees & Flight Escorts** at:
- Thomas World Air Hanger - Jet Center STT
- **Cyril E. King Airport - St. Thomas**
- St. Thomas Jet Center FBO (Fixed Base Operation)

**LSJE Escort(s):** Carlos Rodriguez, Jermaine Ruan, Ramon Linderman
**Manager(s):** Roy Romney - VIPA (Virgin Islands Port Authority), Ann Rodriquez - LSJE

**Analysis:** The operational structure reveals that Epstein had his own employees serving as "escorts" at the airport and working with the Virgin Islands Port Authority. This system allowed Epstein to control the arrival and departure of individuals at St. Thomas airport, potentially circumventing normal CBP processing.

### [EFTA00018778](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00018778.pdf) -- Government of the Virgin Islands v. Estate of Jeffrey Epstein

The GVI First Amended Complaint describes the victim transportation system:

> "Little St. James is a secluded, private island, nearly two miles from St. Thomas with no other residents. It can be visited only by private boat or helicopter; no public or commercial transportation is available to carry persons on or off the island, and no bridge connects the island to St. Thomas. Epstein had easy access to Little St. James from the private airfield on St. Thomas, only 10 minutes away by his private helicopter, but the women and children he trafficked, abused, and held there were not able to leave without his permission and assistance, as it was too far and dangerous to swim to St. Thomas."

> "The Epstein Enterprise transported, held, sexually abused, trafficked, and concealed women and children at his property in the Virgin Islands dozens of times over nearly two decades."

> "Employees and others were required to sign confidentiality agreements that prohibited them from speaking to or sharing information with law enforcement."

## 12. SUPPRESSED EVIDENCE AND REDACTION ANALYSIS

### Multiple Documents with "Clear Customs" References

[EFTA02099089](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA02099089.pdf), [EFTA02099106](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA02099106.pdf), and [EFTA02099118](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA02099118.pdf) all contain redacted text reading "here to clear customs" or "ere to clear customs?" -- suggesting communications about customs clearance procedures that were redacted from the public release.

### [EFTA01305098](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01305098.pdf) -- FBI Report on CBP

This FBI document contains heavily redacted content mentioning "nt-CBP and CBP Sup[ervisor]" and "ion was supervi[sed]" -- indicating an FBI report documenting the supervision (or lack thereof) of CBP operations related to Epstein.

### [EFTA01340344](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01340344.pdf) -- "FROM CBP" Communication

Redacted content shows: "(USANYS)" and "ect: FROM CBP" -- a December 8, 2021 communication from CBP to the prosecution team, content entirely redacted.

### Key Pattern of Redaction

Across the proffer documents ([EFTA00020852](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00020852.pdf) and its duplicates), the following are consistently redacted:
- The name of the witness being proffered
- The name of the CBP employee under investigation
- Email addresses of the SDNY prosecutors
- The specific CBP employee's phone contacts

Despite the redactions, the documents reveal enough context to understand the scope of the corruption investigation.

## 13. KEY FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

### Finding 1: Identified CBP Officer -- Timothy ("Tim") Routch
The officer is **Timothy Routch** (also "Bill Routch"), a CBP Agriculture Specialist (Badge # CAS03223, HashID # CZACMME) who worked at CBP Pre-Clearance in Saint Thomas from 2008-2016. He is confirmed as having:
- A personal friendship with Epstein developed through official duties
- Visited Epstein's house, boat, and flew in his helicopter
- Cleared Epstein's aircraft through customs
- Later transferred to North Charleston, South Carolina
- Been the subject of DOJ and local complaints alleging he assisted in human trafficking
- Self-reported to his supervisor when he learned of the complaints (August 30, 2019)

### Finding 2: FBI Dedicated Investigation
The FBI conducted a dedicated CBP corruption investigation (designated "C-4") that:
- Included proffer sessions with witnesses represented by Crowell & Moring
- Deployed dedicated FBI agents for CBP-specific questioning
- Coordinated with HSI (Homeland Security Investigations)
- Interviewed pilot Larry Visoski about CBP interactions
- Traveled to South Carolina to interview the subject CBP officer
- Was ongoing as late as March 2021

### Finding 3: Systematic Customs Bypass -- Scope Expanded
The proffer questions explicitly asked about:
- Steps CBP employees took to help Epstein "avoid processing that travelers would normally undergo"
- Favors Epstein did for CBP employees including "trips to Epstein's island"
- Identities of ALL CBP employees who interacted with Epstein in the Virgin Islands

DS9 confirms this was far more extensive than one officer. The full corpus reveals:
- **Direct island visits:** [EFTA00874296](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00874296.pdf): Epstein: "please have officer routch come to island for coffee at 130"; [EFTA01972990](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01972990.pdf): "Officer Routch will be at the Dock at 1:30pm"
- **Regular phone contact 2012-2015:** At least 10 documented phone calls/messages between Epstein and Routch across DS9/DS10/DS11
- **Second customs agent groomed:** "Alford Richards" (39 documents) -- a customs agent at STT whom Epstein was personally mentoring with Khan Academy courses, Apple University, and employment placement ([EFTA00344575](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00344575.pdf), [EFTA00339138](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00339138.pdf), [EFTA00340924](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00340924.pdf))
- **Additional named CBP contacts:** "Supervisor Carpenter" ([EFTA00763733](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00763733.pdf): "CM's contact"), "Customs Supervisor Joseph" ([EFTA00416276](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00416276.pdf)), Officers Goico and Marusic at Teterboro

### Finding 4: Critical Evidence Gap
CBP outbound travel records from 1990-2000 were NEVER recorded in the TECS database. This means:
- No records exist of who Epstein and Maxwell took out of the country during peak trafficking years
- Victims transported internationally cannot be traced through border records
- Only inbound arrival records survive from this period
- This gap was confirmed by CBP's own Task Force Officer

### Finding 5: Transportation and Control Infrastructure
Epstein maintained a complete transportation infrastructure in St. Thomas:
- His own employees served as airport escorts
- Coordination with Virgin Islands Port Authority
- Private helicopter service to Little St. James (10 minutes from airfield)
- Victims could not leave the island without Epstein's permission
- Confidentiality agreements prevented employee cooperation with law enforcement

### Finding 6: Multi-Agency Awareness
The evidence shows involvement and awareness across multiple agencies:
- FBI (dedicated C-4 case, proffer sessions)
- SDNY (prosecution team)
- CBP (internal supervisor report, Task Force Officer cooperation)
- HSI (coordination on interview)
- ICE (continued TECS queries years after Epstein's death, from offices in New York, Vienna, and Charlotte)
- NYPD (joint arrest operation)

### Finding 7: CBP Role in 2019 Arrest
Ironically, while one CBP officer helped Epstein evade customs for years, CBP was instrumental in his 2019 arrest through the silent hit notification system. The arrest was triggered by a CBP silent hit at Teterboro Airport on July 6, 2019, when Epstein returned from Paris on his Gulfstream N212JE.

## FULL CORPUS REVISIT INTEGRATION (2026-02-12)

### Indyke DHS Complaint Letter (New Finding)
[EFTA00584279](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00584279.pdf): A 3-page letter from Darren K. Indyke to DHS "Private Aircraft Support" (March 15, 2016) complaining about Teterboro CBP officers who attempted to enforce pre-clearance procedures on N212JE. Indyke demanded a standing blanket authorization letter for Epstein's aircraft -- showing legal intimidation of CBP officers who tried to follow rules.

### FBI Financial Investigation of Routch (New Finding)
FBI issued a grand jury subpoena (May 8, 2020) for Routch's credit reports from all three bureaus: [EFTA01681786](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01681786.pdf) (Experian, June 9, 2020), [EFTA01681789](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01681789.pdf) (Equifax, May 11, 2020), [EFTA01681829](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01681829.pdf) (TransUnion). Reports show a modest financial profile; the investigation was active as of mid-2020.

### Visoski as Planned Maxwell Trial Witness (New Finding)
[EFTA00098971](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00098971.pdf) (May 2021): SDNY was planning to call Visoski as a trial witness at the Maxwell trial (Nov 2021). McGorty coordinated: "He has no specific plans which cannot be moved at this point, but we would only ask that you keep in mind that [he is] going to need to fly up to NY from Florida."

### Pre-Proffer Photo Identification Phase (New Finding)
[EFTA00084236](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00084236.pdf) (July 2020): The investigation began months before the October proffer. The AUSA sent Visoski a photo of Routch to identify, and described: "The individual... may have had a friendship with Jeffrey Epstein... has been to Epstein's home in the Virgin Islands and has accompanied Epstein on boat, helicopter, and/or plane trips. Mr. [redacted] was listed as a contact in [redacted]'s phone, and [he] may have introduced one or more individuals to [redacted] at a bar or other location in the Virgin Islands."

## 15. OPEN QUESTIONS

1. **Was the CBP officer ever criminally charged?** The C-4 investigation appears to have been active through at least March 2021. No public charging documents have been identified.

2. **Were other CBP officers involved?** The proffer questions asked about "identities of any CBP employees" (plural) interacting with Epstein, suggesting the government suspected more than one.

3. **What happened during the 7+ years of customs bypass?** How many people entered or exited through St. Thomas without proper processing?

4. **Why were outbound records not kept before 2000?** This appears to be a systemic CBP policy rather than intentional destruction, but the effect is the same: critical evidence of victim movements is permanently lost.

5. **What was the outcome of the proffer sessions?** The witness cooperated under a proffer agreement, but the substance of their testimony about CBP corruption remains redacted.

6. **What is the connection to the Vienna HSI query?** ICE-Vienna queried Epstein's TECS record on March 6, 2020 -- suggesting European law enforcement interest in the trafficking network.

7. **What did Larry Visoski reveal about CBP interactions?** As Epstein's pilot who cleared customs hundreds of times, Visoski was the primary witness. DS9 confirms Visoski was proffered specifically about Timothy Routch in October-November 2020, and was planned as a Maxwell trial witness. The substance of his testimony remains under proffer protection, but the FBI used his identification of Routch's photo to advance the C-4 case.
