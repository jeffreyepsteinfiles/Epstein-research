# PROSECUTION FAILURES ANALYSIS: THE EPSTEIN FILES

## Comprehensive Documentation of Cases Where Prosecutions Were Considered But Not Brought Against Named Co-Conspirators and Associates

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

The Epstein forensic database reveals a systematic pattern of prosecution failures spanning nearly two decades (2006-2024). Despite overwhelming evidence of a multi-state, international sex trafficking operation involving dozens of identifiable co-conspirators and abusers, only two individuals -- Jeffrey Epstein (2008 state plea; 2019 federal indictment, died pre-trial) and Ghislaine Maxwell (convicted 2021, sentenced to 20 years; Supreme Court certiorari petition filed 4/10/2025, DOJ opposed 7/22/2025; DOJ interviewed Maxwell 7/24-25/2025) -- were ever criminally charged. Every other named individual escaped criminal prosecution through a combination of: (1) the unprecedented 2007 Non-Prosecution Agreement that granted blanket immunity to unnamed co-conspirators; (2) deliberate prosecutorial decisions to narrow investigations; (3) political and institutional barriers; (4) witness non-cooperation by powerful subjects; and (5) jurisdictional complications. The result is a striking pattern of prosecution failures that raises serious questions about the functioning of the criminal justice system.

## PART I: THE ORIGINAL NPA -- ARCHITECTURE OF IMPUNITY (2006-2008)

### 1.1 The Unprecedented Co-Conspirator Immunity Clause

The foundational prosecution failure was embedded in the 2007 Non-Prosecution Agreement itself. The NPA contained a clause of extraordinary scope:

> "In consideration of Epstein's agreement to plead guilty and to provide compensation in the manner described above, if Epstein successfully fulfills all of the terms and conditions of this agreement, the United States agrees that it will not institute any criminal charges against any potential co-conspirators of Epstein, including but not limited to [REDACTED NAMES]."

This clause was not in the original draft NPA. It was proposed by Epstein's defense counsel and gradually expanded during negotiations. Key documents show:

- **[EFTA00009016](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%207/EFTA00009016.pdf) (Acosta deposition, Page 285):** Acosta testified he did not "recall focusing on the coconspirator provision" and speculated that "the focus is on Epstein's going to jail. Whether some of his employees go to jail, or other, lesser involved, is not the focus of this."

- **[EFTA00009016](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%207/EFTA00009016.pdf) (Page 289-290):** Acosta admitted that immunity for non-cooperating co-conspirators was not standard practice: "non-immunity being given to non-cooperating coconspirators, or codefendants? Is that something that was done in your office?" Acosta: "I did not get involved with these."

- **[EFTA00010507](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00010507.pdf) (Page 6):** The line prosecutor's own email revealed the scope creep: "there is no plan to try to proceed on any immigration charges against either Ms. [co-conspirator] or Ms. [co-conspirator]." The prosecutor even offered to meet Epstein's counsel "off campus."

### 1.2 Kirkland & Ellis Defense Campaign

Epstein assembled what Acosta himself described as "an army of legal superstars":

> "Mr. Epstein hired an army of legal superstars, Harvard Professor Dershowitz, former judge and then Pepperdine lodging Ken Starr, former deputy assistant to the president then Kirkland & Ellis law partner Jay Lefkowitz, and several others, including prosecutors that formerly worked in the U.S. Attorney's Office, the child exploitation section of the Department of Justice."

**Source:** [EFTA00009116](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%207/EFTA00009116.pdf) (Acosta OPR interview, Page 396)

Kirkland & Ellis aggressively argued against federal prosecution:

- **[EFTA00013811](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00013811.pdf):** Kirkland argued "there is insufficient evidence that Mr. Epstein targeted minors" and claimed victims "lied to Mr. Epstein about their ages."

- **[EFTA00009116](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%207/EFTA00009116.pdf) (Page 391):** Acosta was personally threatened: "I might be personally embarrassed by pursuing this matter, because I would be the subject of a chapter in a book on prosecutorial overreach." The threatened author: "Professor Dershowitz."

### 1.3 Main Justice / DAG Review

The defense team appealed directly to the Deputy Attorney General's office, creating a parallel review that stalled prosecution:

- **[EFTA00013555](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00013555.pdf) (June 23, 2008, DOJ Washington letter to Kirkland & Ellis):** The DAG's office completed its review and wrote: "We do not believe such intervention is warranted here. Even if we were to substitute our judgment for that of the U.S. Attorney, we believe that federal prosecution of this case is appropriate."

- **[EFTA00009116](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%207/EFTA00009116.pdf) (Page 237):** Acosta's fear was clear: "is main justice on board, or are we going to basically be told to drop this case when it goes up to main justice?"

- **[EFTA00009116](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%207/EFTA00009116.pdf) (Pages 333-336):** The appeals process "was stymying progress" but Acosta felt he could not simply indict because it would raise "civil litigation overlays."

- **[EFTA00013989](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00013989.pdf):** Kirkland noted that CEOS (Child Exploitation and Obscenity Section) reviewed the matter only for "abuse of discretion" -- not de novo -- making "the outcome a foregone conclusion."

### 1.4 OPR Finding: "Poor Judgment" but Not "Professional Misconduct"

The complete DOJ Office of Professional Responsibility Executive Summary (November 2020), available in full at [EFTA00095558](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00095558.pdf) (DS9, 13 pages), concluded that Acosta exercised "poor judgment" but did not commit "professional misconduct." OPR conducted more than 60 interviews and reviewed hundreds of thousands of records. Notably, OPR explicitly found no evidence that Acosta's decision "was based on corruption or other impermissible considerations, such as Epstein's wealth, status, or associations," while finding that "the victims were not treated with the forthrightness and sensitivity expected by the Department." This finding provides context for the prosecution failures documented throughout this report -- the official determination characterized the NPA as poor judgment within prosecutorial discretion, even as its consequences enabled the architecture of impunity described below.

### 1.5 CVRA Violations -- Concealment from Victims

The NPA was deliberately concealed from victims in violation of the Crime Victims' Rights Act:

- **[EFTA00014116](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00014116.pdf) (Acosta email, Aug 2, 2008):** "As I recall, we also believed that contacting the victims would compromise them as potential witnesses. Epstein argued very forcefully that they were doing this for the money."

- **[EFTA00010507](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00010507.pdf) (Page 9):** After the NPA was signed, "Epstein's counsel and the Office began negotiations about whether the victims would be told about the NPA. It was a deviation from the Government's standard practice to negotiate with defense counsel about the extent of crime victim notifications."

- **[EFTA00010507](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00010507.pdf) (Page 16):** On January 10, 2008, victims were sent letters stating the case was "currently under investigation" and requesting "continued patience" -- despite the NPA already being signed.

- **[EFTA00010507](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00010507.pdf) (Page 28):** Judge Marra found: "the Government... chose to conceal the existence of the NPA from the victims" and that "the Government spent untold hours negotiating the terms and implications of the NPA with Epstein's attorneys, scant information was shared with victims."

- **[EFTA00073493](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00073493.pdf) / [EFTA00074599](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00074599.pdf) (11th Circuit, *In re Wild*, 955 F.3d 1196 (2020) and 994 F.3d 1244 (2021)):** The full appellate decisions confirmed Judge Marra's findings and explicitly stated that "it was highly unusual -- never seen before -- that the government would extend federal immunity to Epstein's co-conspirators." The court documented the nine-month concealment period during which "the Office misrepresented to the victims that 'this case' was still under investigation, advised them 'to be patient,' and never disclosed the government's NPA with Epstein." The court further found that "the coconspirators had not cooperated or assisted the government. Rather, the sole consideration for their federal immunity was that Epstein plead to two state charges."

### 1.6 The State Plea Transcript Revelation

- **[EFTA00027590](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00027590.pdf)/[EFTA00027591](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00027591.pdf) (State plea transcript, Pages 38-39):** Epstein's counsel stated on the record: "there is a nonprosecution agreement with the United States Attorney's office that triggers as a result of this plea agreement." SDNY prosecutors later flagged this: "Check out pages 38-39 of his state plea" -- showing the NPA was explicitly tied to the minimal state disposition.

---

## PART II: NAMED INDIVIDUALS -- PROSECUTION CONSIDERED AND DECLINED

### 2.1 PRINCE ANDREW -- "Not Presently a Target"

**Evidence gathered:** The SDNY filed a formal Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty (MLAT) request to the UK on April 3, 2020, seeking to interview Prince Andrew regarding TWO investigations (Epstein and Nygard). The MLAT request stated:

> "There is evidence that Prince Andrew engaged in sexual conduct involving one of Epstein's victims. Prince Andrew is not presently a target of the investigation, and U.S. authorities have not, to date, gathered evidence that he has committed any crime under U.S. law."

**Source:** [EFTA00022062](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00022062.pdf) (MLAT request, April 3, 2020)

**What happened:**

- **[EFTA00022980](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00022980.pdf) (January-September 2020):** A months-long correspondence between SDNY prosecutors and Prince Andrew's lawyer Gary Bloxsome at Blackfords LLP reveals systematic obstruction. SDNY repeatedly pressed for an interview; Prince Andrew's team stalled, demanded conditions, and ultimately refused.

- **[EFTA00017042](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00017042.pdf) (January 27, 2020):** After U.S. Attorney Berman publicly stated Andrew had not cooperated, Bloxsome objected to the "misleading impression." SDNY responded: "he corrected the record generally in a factually accurate statement."

- **[EFTA00014243](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00014243.pdf) (March 9, 2020):** Reuters reported: "Prince Andrew has declined to cooperate with a U.S. investigation into possible co-conspirators of deceased financier and accused sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein."

- **[EFTA00010321](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00010321.pdf) (September 23, 2020):** SDNY informed Bloxsome: "We understand that your client has declined to sit for a voluntary interview... we intend to move forward with our MLA request seeking a compelled interview."

- **[EFTA00019885](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00019885.pdf) (February 14, 2020):** Bloxsome wrote: "we have reached the conclusion that the DOJ's dealings with the Duke of York have not been designed to seek his assistance in investigating and prosecuting the targets of the investigation but instead have been used only to gather publicity for Mr. Geoffrey S. Berman."

- **[EFTA00022201](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00022201.pdf) (July 31, 2020):** Andrew's lawyers demanded: (1) evidence not be used for any purpose other than Maxwell proceedings; (2) his statements not be used against him.

**Prosecution decision:** Andrew was never charged. He settled Virginia Giuffre's civil lawsuit. The MLAT process was never completed. Despite evidence of "sexual conduct involving one of Epstein's victims," prosecutors determined they had "not gathered evidence that he has committed any crime under U.S. law" -- a formulation that could reflect either the limits of evidence gathered or the scope of the investigation conducted.

### 2.2 LEON BLACK -- $62.5M Settlement, Zero Charges

**Evidence gathered:**
- Multiple victims named Black as an abuser
- SDNY and Manhattan DA both investigated (2021-2024)
- FBI 302 interviews conducted
- $62.5 million settlement with USVI (July 2023)

**Key documents:**

- **[EFTA02731473](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2012/EFTA02731473.pdf) (July 24, 2023):** Attorney Jeanne Christensen (Wigdor LLP) emailed SDNY: "In case you have not heard it has been discovered that Leon Black paid 62.5 million to USVI - and this does not include payments of money to individual women - it's outrageous that criminal charges have not been brought against him. I've heard one lawyer represents ten women that he sexually assaulted."

- **[EFTA02731660](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2012/EFTA02731660.pdf) (July 22, 2023):** Internal SDNY email reveals the decision: "there does not appear to be any evidence of overlap with Maxwell other than the allegations of the victim in DANY's open investigation of Black and CRU doesn't intend to open anything separate based on current information."

- **[EFTA02731651](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2012/EFTA02731651.pdf):** The matter was transferred to SDNY's "Civil Rights Unit" -- a unit that was "now handling all trafficking matters" -- but no charges resulted.

- **[EFTA02731721](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2012/EFTA02731721.pdf) (March 2024):** A victim's attorney described a victim who "was told Leon Black is VIP because he is a special friend of Jeffrey's -- and told this to make sure she did what she was supposed to do."

**Prosecution decision:** Despite at least 4 victims, FBI interviews, a $62.5M civil settlement (without admission of wrongdoing), and active DANY investigation, SDNY's Civil Rights Unit declined to open a separate investigation. No federal charges were ever filed.

### 2.3 JES STALEY -- Rape Allegation, International Coordination, No Charges

**Evidence gathered:**
- Direct email exchanges between Staley and Epstein ([EFTA00029429](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00029429.pdf)-00029434)
- FCA/PRA investigation in UK
- SDNY coordination with UK regulators
- Rape allegation from victim

**Key documents:**

- **[EFTA00029358](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00029358.pdf) (December 14, 2019):** SDNY prosecutor flagged: "Don't know if you caught this but one of the non/minor Epstein victims alleges that Jes Staley (reads in memo as 'Jess Daily') raped her during a massage. P. 31"

- **[EFTA00022164](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00022164.pdf) (December 10, 2019):** SDNY was coordinating with the FCA: "We're doing a brief follow up call this morning at 10 with the FCA, the British regulator who, as discussed, is looking at Jes Staley and his potential relationship with Epstein... a request from us that they not go overt anytime soon."

- **[EFTA00023410](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00023410.pdf) (February 26, 2020):** Media inquired about "how UK law enforcement is involved in an investigation into Barclays PLC CEO Jes Staley and his relationship with Jeffrey Epstein."

- **[EFTA00025082](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00025082.pdf) (February 13, 2020):** When FT reporter asked about "information DOJ had passed to the UK FCA about Jes Staley's relationship with Epstein," SDNY responded: "we cannot provide guidance. We'll decline to comment."

- **[EFTA00029429](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00029429.pdf)-00029434 (Epstein-Staley emails):** These exchanges show deeply troubling content. Staley asked "Is she free tonight?" about a woman Epstein was providing. In another: "Beauty and the Beast." Epstein referenced "Snow White." Epstein wrote: "prince Andrew would like much more to represent casanov in china than tim collins."

**Prosecution decision:** Despite a rape allegation flagged by an SDNY prosecutor, email evidence of Staley requesting women from Epstein, and coordinated UK regulatory investigation, no criminal charges were ever filed against Staley in any jurisdiction.

### 2.4 BILL RICHARDSON -- "So, So Frustrating"

**Evidence gathered:**
- Victim testimony (deposition) alleging she was "ordered to" have sex with Richardson
- SDNY considered his status (witness/subject/target)

**Key documents:**

- **[EFTA00014374](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00014374.pdf) (August 18, 2019):** SDNY prosecutor's memo of call with Richardson's counsel Jeff Brown: "deposition says, in sum and substance, was ordered to, but doesn't appear to say that anything actually happened." Prosecutor classified Richardson as effectively a "subject" -- not witness, not target.

- **[EFTA00014372](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00014372.pdf) (August 21, 2019):** Senior SDNY prosecutor reacted: "This is so, so frustrating." The frustration arose because Richardson's counsel presented blanket denials that contradicted sworn victim testimony, and the prosecutor had inadvertently conveyed too comfortable a status classification.

- Richardson's counsel offered a proffer but "he expected client would not have much, if anything, of substance to proffer."

**Prosecution decision:** Despite sworn victim testimony, SDNY did not subpoena or compel testimony from Richardson. He was never charged. He died in September 2023.

### 2.5 ALAN DERSHOWITZ -- Named by Multiple Victims, Never Investigated

**Evidence gathered:**
- Multiple victims named Dershowitz as a participant in abuse
- Dershowitz simultaneously negotiated Epstein's NPA while being named as an abuser

**Key documents:**

- **[EFTA00021553](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00021553.pdf) (January 2, 2015, court filing, Page 4):** "One such powerful individual that Epstein forced then-minor Jane Doe #3 to have sexual relations with was former Harvard Law Professor Alan Dershowitz... Epstein required Jane Doe #3 to have sexual relations with Dershowitz on numerous occasions while she was a minor, not only in Florida but also on private planes, in New York, New Mexico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands."

- **[EFTA00021553](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00021553.pdf) (Page 4, continued):** "Dershowitz would later play a significant role in negotiating the NPA on Epstein's behalf. Indeed, Dershowitz helped negotiate an agreement that provided immunity from prosecution." (Note: Allegations against Dershowitz emerged publicly in 2014 court filings — years after the 2007-2008 NPA. Whether the blanket immunity provision was designed to protect any specific individual cannot be established from the available documents.)

- **[EFTA00009116](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%207/EFTA00009116.pdf) (Page 391):** Acosta confirmed that the defense team raised the threat of a book chapter on "prosecutorial overreach": "the book reference was that I might be personally embarrassed by pursuing this matter, because I would be the subject of a chapter in a book on prosecutorial overreach." The specific defense team member who made this reference is not identified in the transcript.

- **[EFTA00010380](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00010380.pdf) (July 31, 2020):** Daily Mail asked SDNY about "the claim in newly unsealed court documents that Prince Andrew and Alan Dershowitz put pressure on the DOJ to give Epstein a favorable plea deal in 2007."

- **[EFTA00092643](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00092643.pdf) / [EFTA00105307](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00105307.pdf) (DS9, wire transfer records):** A $20,532 payment on 3/5/2015 from the Butterfly Trust to "Coffey Burlington (Alan Dershowitz)" via Coconut Grove Bank establishes a direct financial link between Epstein and Dershowitz that extends well beyond the NPA negotiation period.

**Prosecution decision:** Dershowitz was never investigated, never interviewed as a subject, and never charged. He simultaneously served as Epstein's defense attorney while being named as an abuser -- and the blanket co-conspirator immunity provision he helped negotiate ultimately shielded him from prosecution when allegations emerged publicly in 2014.

### 2.6 GLENN AND EVA DUBIN -- "Lent Out"

**Evidence gathered:**
- Victim testimony about being "lent out" to Glenn Dubin
- 54 documents referencing the Dubins in the database

**Key documents:**

- **[EFTA02731082](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2012/EFTA02731082.pdf) (SDNY privileged prosecution memo):** Victim "used the term 'lent out' to describe instances in which Maxwell or Epstein directed her to have sexual contact with other men."

- **[EFTA02731168](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2012/EFTA02731168.pdf) (Maxwell prosecution memo):** Corroboration section notes: "When Alessi first began working for Epstein, he recalls that Epstein's girlfriend was Eva" -- establishing long-term connection.

- **[EFTA00022133](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00022133.pdf) (Accusation summary):** "Epstein directed her to have sex with Glen Dubin."

- **[EFTA01249021](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA01249021.pdf) (DS9, FBI 302 interview, 8 pages, dated 9/9/2019):** The primary source FBI interview provides detailed testimony that the victim was "lent out" to Eva Andersson and Glen Dubin at "the Breakers." Maxwell told the victim "she had to do to DUBIN what she did for EPSTEIN." The victim "was lent out so many times that she started to use drugs." Maxwell was described as a "mastermind" who "hated the girls" but "got off on it."

**Prosecution decision:** Despite victim testimony using the term "lent out" -- directly implicating the Dubins in the sex trafficking conspiracy -- and despite the detailed primary source FBI 302 now available, no investigation or charges were pursued against either Glenn or Eva Dubin.

### 2.7 SARAH KELLEN / NADIA MARCINKOVA -- NPA Co-Conspirators, Plea Negotiations

**Evidence gathered:**
- Named as co-conspirators in the NPA ([EFTA00176610](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00176610.pdf))
- Identified as employees in the 2019 SDNY Indictment
- NPA explicitly waived immigration proceedings against Marcinkova and Ross: "will not request, initiate, or in any way encourage immigration authorities to institute immigration proceedings against Ross or Marcinkova" ([EFTA00176610](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00176610.pdf); confirmed during negotiations at [EFTA00193954](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00193954.pdf), page 10)
- Plea negotiations conducted with one redacted co-conspirator

**Key documents:**

- **[EFTA00013209](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00013209.pdf) (DAG Meeting Case Overview, November 5, 2020):** "we are in plea negotiations with counsel for [REDACTED], another Epstein co-conspirator, who scheduled hundreds of sexual massages with minors for Epstein but was also a victim of his sexual abuse, may plead to an obstruction of justice-related count." Note: This document discusses ONE redacted individual, not both Kellen and Marcinkova.

- **[EFTA00089268](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00089268.pdf) (Plea draft documents):** Reference "hundreds of appointments," "dozens of minors," and "2-3/day" — language closely matching the DAG memo. The scheduling role and plea draft content more closely match Sarah Kellen's documented function. Susan Necheles (who later represented Maxwell at trial) served as defense counsel for this individual.

- **[EFTA00024285](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00024285.pdf) / [EFTA00016245](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00016245.pdf) (April 7, 2020, internal SDNY emails):** The prosecution team debated whether to charge: "she thinks it's a close call between making [REDACTED] take 2 felony plea and declining to prosecute, but she ultimately comes down in favor of a felony plea. She does not think we should charge [REDACTED] with sex trafficking."

- The Human Trafficking Coordinators wrote: "our Office ordinarily would decline to prosecute a victim-participant like [REDACTED] absent certain aggravating factors, such as the use of violence by the victim-participant on others, or the victim-perpetrator continuing to run a sex trafficking operation in the absence of her abuser. Because those aggravating factors are not present here, the Coordinators believe it is a very close call."

- **[EFTA00016245](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00016245.pdf):** A supervisor noted the "change in our views of [REDACTED's] obstructive conduct (particularly with respect to destruction of materials)" and suggested highlighting "just the large number of underage victims."

- **[EFTA00014493](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00014493.pdf) (July 16, 2019, SDNY letter to court):** Referenced one individual "also named as a potential co-conspirator -- and for whom Epstein also obtained protection in -- the NPA."

**Identity of the redacted co-conspirator:** The DAG memo's description — "scheduled hundreds of sexual massages with minors" and "also a victim of his sexual abuse" — is redacted. The scheduling language and plea draft evidence ([EFTA00089268](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00089268.pdf)) more strongly match Sarah Kellen, whose primary documented role was scheduling abuse sessions. The "also a victim" language is more commonly associated with Marcinkova's documented history (brought from Yugoslavia as a minor). The identity cannot be confirmed from the available documents.

**Prosecution decision:** The co-conspirator was offered a plea to obstruction rather than trafficking. The internal debate characterized this as a "close call" -- but ultimately, no public charges were ever filed against Kellen or Marcinkova. The plea negotiations collapsed or were abandoned.

### 2.8 JEAN-LUC BRUNEL -- Died Before Trial

**Evidence gathered:**
- Multiple victim allegations of procuring underage models
- French investigation opened
- SDNY-French coordination ([EFTA00021720](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00021720.pdf))
- Arrested in France December 2020

**Key documents:**

- **[EFTA00021720](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00021720.pdf) (January 2021):** DOJ coordinated with French investigating judges: "There are three investigating judges assigned to this case, which is pretty unusual...and suggests its importance for them." France could hold Brunel for "up to 3-4 years while the investigation continues."

- **[EFTA00021720](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00021720.pdf):** French made clear reciprocity was required: "they are not going to help SDNY unless we show a good faith effort to help them, and begin sending evidence their way."

- **[EFTA00020911](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00020911.pdf) (November 2019):** Victim attorney Sigrid McCawley connected French judicial police with SDNY prosecutors, noting French authorities "had reached out to certain government officials in the US to try to coordinate your efforts but had not received any substantive communication or assistance."

**Prosecution outcome:** Brunel was found dead in his Paris jail cell on February 19, 2022, in an apparent suicide -- repeating the pattern of Epstein's own death. He was never tried. The circumstances of his death remain controversial.

### 2.9 EHUD BARAK

**Evidence gathered:**
- Multiple documents showing contact between Epstein and Barak
- Scheduling of meetings, dinners

**Key documents:**

- **[EFTA02422165](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02422165.pdf):** Epstein email to assistant: "Jes plans to attend the Ehud Barak dinner"
- **[EFTA02422168](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02422168.pdf):** "Tom Barrack-Ehud Barak" meeting arranged
- **[EFTA02575361](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02575361.pdf):** Direct email between Epstein and Barak

**Prosecution decision:** Despite documentary evidence of extensive contact, Barak was never investigated or charged in any jurisdiction.

### 2.10 LARRY SUMMERS

**Evidence gathered:**
- Extensive email correspondence showing ongoing relationship with Epstein well after 2008 conviction
- Meeting arrangements continuing through 2017

**Key documents:**

- **[EFTA00362463](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00362463.pdf) (September 2014):** Summers' assistant arranging meetings: "Jeffrey will be in NY the week of Sept. 21st...Larry has told him he will be in NY on Monday 22nd...might we be able to get the two of them together?"

- **[EFTA02233990](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02233990.pdf) (December 2017):** Summers emailing Epstein directly: "R u in ny. I'm st Carlyle" -- showing casual, continuing contact years after Epstein's conviction.

- **[EFTA02674889](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02674889.pdf) (May 2013):** Summers to Epstein: "I spoke for your friend Leon Black's investor event today. Thought of you."

**Prosecution decision:** Despite being named by a victim as an abuser (per prior session findings), and confirmed ongoing contact with a registered sex offender, Summers was never investigated or charged.

---

## PART III: INSTITUTIONAL AND STRUCTURAL FAILURES

### 3.1 The SDNY Investigation Memo to ODAG (May 2019)

- **[EFTA00009936](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00009936.pdf) (May 15, 2019):** SDNY sent an "update on the progress of the Epstein investigation" to ODAG, marked: "Please keep this memo on close hold given the sensitivity of the matter and our effort remain covert."

This memo, sent two months before Epstein's arrest, shows SDNY was actively investigating while maintaining secrecy from ODAG -- a posture reflecting distrust of DOJ hierarchy.

### 3.2 The DAG Meeting -- Cases "Likely to Generate Substantial Press"

- **[EFTA00013208](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00013208.pdf) (November 5, 2020):** SDNY briefed the Deputy Attorney General's office on cases "likely to generate substantial press over the next couple months." Briefing superiors on high-profile cases is standard DOJ practice, but the framing illustrates the media-awareness context in which prosecution decisions were made.

### 3.3 AG Barr's Selective Recusal

- **[EFTA00018398](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00018398.pdf) (July 9, 2019):** AG Barr recused himself from the "retrospective review" of the Florida NPA (because Kirkland & Ellis, which he joined in 2009, had represented Epstein) but did NOT recuse from the ongoing SDNY prosecution. This created a structural conflict: the AG who could influence the current case had institutional ties to the firm that negotiated the original immunity deal.

### 3.4 BOP Employee Prosecution Declination

- **[EFTA00035812](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00035812.pdf) (September 2021):** The DOJ Inspector General's office investigated BOP employees for false certifications related to Epstein's death. After presenting findings to SDNY, "it was determined that the USAO SDNY would not prosecute" Lieutenant Roberto [REDACTED], Material Handler Supervisor [REDACTED], or Correctional Officer Tova Noel.

- **[EFTA00126052](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00126052.pdf) (DS9, OIG Memorandum of Investigation):** The full OIG memo confirms the declination decision was made within a single day of presentation. The AUSA consulted with the "USAO SDNY supervisor of the Public Corruption Unit" on September 20-21, 2021, and the decision not to prosecute was reached immediately.

- **[EFTA00161426](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00161426.pdf) (DS9, FBI Case Summary Briefing Deck):** The death investigation (case 90A-NY-3151227) was formally **closed on 12/5/2022** with "no criminality found pertaining to Epstein's death."

This declination and rapid case closure meant that no one was held criminally responsible for the conditions that enabled Epstein's death, despite documented failures in custody procedures.

### 3.5 The CVRA Litigation Paradox

- **[EFTA00027440](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00027440.pdf) (December 2020):** Even years after the CVRA violation was found by Judge Marra, SDNY's victim notification letter deliberately omitted CVRA references: "the letter does not expressly reference the CVRA, because other DOJ components are currently litigating whether the CVRA applies in the context of a pre-indictment plea."

This created a paradox: DOJ acknowledged the moral obligation to notify victims while simultaneously litigating to avoid the legal obligation to do so.

### 3.6 The Maxwell Trial -- Narrowing the Lens

- **[EFTA00014713](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00014713.pdf) (November 23, 2021):** A journalist previewing the Maxwell trial noted the contradiction: writing about "Maxwell's most prominent public accuser, [REDACTED], not being part of this case; no charges based on her allegations and not expected to be a witness for Gov."

- **[EFTA00021049](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00021049.pdf):** SDNY responded: "no comment."

The Maxwell prosecution was narrowed to specific victims and a specific time period. The most prominent accusers and the most powerful alleged abusers were not part of the case.

### 3.7 Maxwell Post-Trial Developments

Per [EFTA00161426](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00161426.pdf) and [EFTA00163378](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00163378.pdf) (DS9):

- **July 7, 2022:** Maxwell filed appeal of conviction
- **September 17, 2024:** Federal appellate court upheld conviction
- **April 10, 2025:** Writ of Certiorari filed with Supreme Court, arguing the NPA should have barred her prosecution
- **July 22, 2025:** DOJ formally opposed the writ
- **July 24-25, 2025:** DOJ interviewed Maxwell
- SDNY also chose not to pursue Maxwell's 2 remaining perjury charges after the initial trial

Maxwell argued to the Supreme Court that "a defendant should be able to rely on a promise that the United States will not prosecute again, without being subject to a gotcha in some other jurisdiction" -- directly invoking the NPA co-conspirator immunity clause that forms the foundation of Part I of this report.

---

## PART IV: THE LONDON INTERVIEW AND CO-CONSPIRATOR PURSUIT

### 4.1 Travel to London for Co-Conspirator Interview (March 2020)

- **[EFTA00037448](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00037448.pdf) (March 2020):** FBI/NYPD agents requested travel to London to interview a "witness/co-conspirator of Jeffrey Epstein's." The request stated: "This interview could prove to be vital to the indictment of another co-conspirator of Jeffrey Epstein which is expected to go to grand jury within a few weeks. This person was witness to and potentially participated in the sexual abuse of minor victims by Jeffery Epstein and his co-conspirators."

The trip was planned for March 16-20, 2020, but was disrupted by COVID travel restrictions. The "co-conspirator" expected to be indicted "within a few weeks" appears to be Maxwell, who was charged in July 2020.

### 4.2 Co-Conspirator Photo Compilation

- **[EFTA00037629](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00037629.pdf) (August 19, 2019):** FBI/NYPD Child Exploitation Human Trafficking Task Force circulated "Epstein Co-conspirator pics" -- suggesting active identification and tracking of multiple co-conspirators. Yet only Maxwell was ever charged.

---

## PART V: THE PROSECUTION MEMO -- WHAT SDNY KNEW AND CHOSE NOT TO PURSUE

### 5.1 The Maxwell Prosecution Memorandum (April 10, 2020)

The most revealing document is the SDNY's own prosecution memorandum for Maxwell:

- **[EFTA02731168](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2012/EFTA02731168.pdf) (Page 26):** "Cooperating Defendants: None currently and none expected."

- **[EFTA02731168](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2012/EFTA02731168.pdf) (Page 26):** The discovery section revealed systemic FBI failures: "we have not received most of the materials seized in July and August of 2019, which comprise many terabytes of data. Assuming we eventually receive those materials and appropriately review them for pertinence, we nevertheless note that discovery in this case will be significant."

- **[EFTA02731082](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2012/EFTA02731082.pdf) (Privileged memo):** Documents extensive victim interviews detailing abuse by multiple named individuals -- yet the prosecution was narrowed to Maxwell alone.

### 5.2 The 2016 AUSA Meeting -- "Wants Prosecution"

- **[EFTA00029100](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00029100.pdf) (Maxwell defense filing):** In February 2016, victim attorneys met with an AUSA and "pitched" a prosecution of Maxwell and Epstein. The AUSA's contemporaneous notes stated: "[REDACTED] wants prosecution." The AUSA "emailed the Chief of the Criminal Division just days after the meeting to discuss the 'intriguing' case."

Despite this 2016 push, no prosecution was initiated until July 2019 -- more than three years later, and only after the Miami Herald's investigation generated significant public pressure.

## PART VII: PATTERNS AND CONCLUSIONS

### Pattern 1: The Immunity Architecture
The 2007 NPA created a structural barrier to prosecution that persisted for over a decade. Its co-conspirator immunity clause -- unprecedented in scope -- was negotiated by attorneys (including Dershowitz) who were themselves alleged participants in the criminal conduct. Judge Marra found in 2019 that the NPA violated the CVRA, but by then the statute of limitations had expired for much of the underlying conduct.

### Pattern 2: Narrowing the Investigation
At every stage, prosecutors narrowed rather than expanded investigations. The 2008 Florida investigation was narrowed from a federal indictment to a state plea. The 2019 SDNY investigation was narrowed from dozens of potential co-conspirators to just Epstein. The 2020 Maxwell indictment was narrowed to specific victims and time periods. The Leon Black investigation was deferred to DANY and then abandoned.

### Pattern 3: Wealth and Access as Shield
Every individual who escaped prosecution was wealthy, powerful, or both. Epstein's defense team had direct access to the U.S. Attorney and the Deputy Attorney General. Prince Andrew's lawyers negotiated for months without providing cooperation. Leon Black's $62.5M settlement to USVI -- reached without admission of wrongdoing -- did not lead to further criminal investigation.

### Pattern 4: Jurisdictional Fragmentation
Responsibility was diffused across SDFL, SDNY, DANY, UK FCA, French investigating judges, and USVI. No single authority maintained comprehensive responsibility. The French investigation of Brunel and the UK regulatory investigation of Staley were coordinated with but not driven by SDNY.

### Pattern 5: Death as Resolution
Both Epstein and Brunel died in custody before trial -- the only two individuals against whom serious criminal proceedings were advancing. Their deaths effectively ended the possibility of cooperative testimony that could have implicated others.

### Pattern 6: The Victim-Perpetrator Dilemma
The most prosecution-ready co-conspirators (Kellen, Marcinkova) were also victims of Epstein's abuse. This created a genuine dilemma documented in the April 2020 internal SDNY emails -- but the resolution was to charge no one rather than to separate the victim-participants from the pure perpetrators.
