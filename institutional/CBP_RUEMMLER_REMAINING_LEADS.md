## LEAD 1: CBP OFFICER (Badge #CAS03223) -- FULL FINDINGS

### PRIMARY DOCUMENT: [EFTA00031495](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00031495.pdf) -- The Confession

**Document Type:** FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY -- Internal CBP Memorandum
**Date:** Friday, August 30, 2019, 0730 hrs
**Location:** CBP CES, Supervisor's office, North Charleston, SC

A CBP Agriculture Specialist (CBPAS) with **Badge # CAS03223 / HashID # CZACMME** voluntarily stepped into his supervisor's office in North Charleston, SC to disclose that a former female acquaintance had filed two complaints against him:

**ISSUE 1 -- DOJ Complaint:**
> "The female acquaintance of Mr. [REDACTED] has informed the Federal Department of Justice, that Mr. [REDACTED] is a known associate of Jeffery Epstein, had ongoing friendship with Mr. Epstein, and that while working for CBP Pre-Clearance in Saint Thomas for over 7 years, and assisted Mr. Epstein for conducting human trafficking of underage females."

When asked how the acquaintance would know about his associations, the officer stated:
> **"Everyone knew I was friends with Jeffery Epstein."** He further stated: **"I have been to his house, been on his boat, and flew in helicopter for whale watching."**

**ISSUE 2 -- Charleston County Sheriff Complaint:**
The same acquaintance accused the officer of "predatory behavior, targeting widows, and vulnerable persons." The supervisor recalled prior issues with a landlord (an older female) who took him to court over monetary disputes.

**KEY FINDINGS FROM PAGE 2 ([EFTA00031495](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00031495.pdf), OCR id 37293):**

The supervisor's summary states:
> "CBPAS [REDACTED], Charleston S.C., provided information connecting him to a convicted child molester while working for CBP; with accusations potentially ensnaring CBP's reputation as an agency."

Specific findings:
- **While at the pre-clearance port of Saint Thomas, USVI (beginning in 2008)**, the officer "pal'd around with Mr. Epstein, clearing his aircraft; and spending personal time with the convict after befriending him, entering into that friendship through carrying out CBP official duty."
- The officer transferred from Saint Thomas, USVI to Charleston, SC
- He had "rocky relationships with previous single female as a landlord" upon arriving in Charleston
- A separate female acquaintance attempted suicide; she is the one filing complaints
- The officer was "concerned, worried, and a bit shaken, about federal investigators looking into his past"

**NAME STATUS:** The officer's name remains redacted throughout (rendered as [REDACTED]/[EEE]/[ERR] patterns in OCR). The document text database for [EFTA00031495](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00031495.pdf) confirms these are "bad_overlay" redactions with high confidence (0.99) covering the badge area and name fields, but the underlying text could not be recovered.

### CORROBORATING CBP INVESTIGATION DOCUMENTS

#### [EFTA00038585](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00038585.pdf) -- "C-4 CBP Case" (March 30, 2021)
An FBI agent emails a colleague about the same officer:
> "After we interviewed Larry Visoski in November for our case, we have been trying to coordinate with our HSI partners to interview our subject, in an effort to close the loop on our case. We have finally set a date and are **traveling to South Carolina next week to interview him.** (Our subject is a **CBP employee who previously covered St. Thomas airport**, and supposedly knew/socialized with Epstein)"

This confirms:
- FBI and HSI (Homeland Security Investigations) were jointly investigating this officer
- The officer was the same person: CBP employee, formerly Saint Thomas, now South Carolina
- Larry Visoski (Epstein's pilot) had already been interviewed for this case
- The interview was coordinated as a "C-4" case (CBP internal affairs investigation)

#### [EFTA00020852](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00020852.pdf) -- "Wednesday's WebEx" Proffer Sessions (Oct-Nov 2020)
Multiple emails between SDNY prosecutors and defense attorney Glen G. McGorty (Crowell & Moring LLP) arranging a proffer interview about the CBP officer. Key details:

From the October 26, 2020 email:
> "We expect to ask Mr. [REDACTED] about his interactions with [REDACTED], the U.S. Customs and Border Protection employee who worked in Saint Thomas and **who had Mr. [REDACTED] listed as a contact in his phone.** I expect we will ask for an approximate timeline of when Mr. [REDACTED] met and interacted with [REDACTED], the nature of those interactions, and any interactions [REDACTED] may have had with Epstein."

From the November 10, 2020 email:
> "We will be joined by **two FBI agents who are focusing on the CBP topics** that we have previously discussed. The topics we expect to cover include:
> - The identities of any CBP employees Mr. [REDACTED] recalls interacting with Jeffrey Epstein in the Virgin Islands.
> - **Any steps Mr. [REDACTED] recalls any CBP employees in the Virgin Islands taking to help Epstein and those traveling with Epstein to enter the country, including any steps that allowed Epstein or those traveling with him to avoid processing that travelers would normally undergo.**
> - Any favors Mr. [REDACTED] recalls Epstein doing for CBP employees in the Virgin Islands, such as trips to Epstein's island."

A proffer agreement was executed on November 12, 2020 ([EFTA00015006](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00015006.pdf), [EFTA00024932](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00024932.pdf), [EFTA00015013](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00015013.pdf)).

#### 7. [EFTA02484285](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02484285.pdf) -- October 12, 2015 (CRITICAL)
Epstein to Ruemmler:
> "seen as the good friend that you are. might **bring unhelpful criticism of the important role model that you have become for women**... **defense counsel might create clinton obama unnecessary implication.** either way I appreciate the help but **we should be extra thoughtful. as surrounded by publicity seeking lawyers** etc"
- **This is the most significant email.** Epstein explicitly references:

- Discussing a professional opportunity involving a "Nigerian" decision-maker; Epstein coaching Ruemmler on how to win the position

### REDACTION DATABASE ENTRIES FOR RUEMMLER

The redaction databases (both v2 and ds10) contain **10 entries** with Ruemmler's name in hidden text, all as "bad_overlay" redactions:

| EFTA Number | Page | Hidden Text | Confidence |
|-------------|------|-------------|------------|
| [EFTA02065458](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA02065458.pdf) | 2 | Ruemmler | 0.7518 |
| [EFTA02065485](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA02065485.pdf) | 2 | Kathy Ruemmler | 0.7864 |
| [EFTA02065525](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA02065525.pdf) | 2 | Kath Ruemmler | 0.8012 |
| [EFTA02066240](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA02066240.pdf) | 0 | Kathy Ruemmler | 0.7964 |
| [EFTA02066243](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA02066243.pdf) | 0 | Richard Kahn / Re: Kathy Ruemmler | 0.9423 |
| [EFTA02075484](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA02075484.pdf) | 0 | Ruemmler | 0.7662 |
| [EFTA02092624](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA02092624.pdf) | 0 | To: Kath Ruemmler | 0.8287 |
| [EFTA02195931](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA02195931.pdf) | 0 | Cc: Kathy Ruemmler | 0.8227 |
| [EFTA02196090](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA02196090.pdf) | 0 | Kathy Ruemmler | 0.7998 |
| [EFTA02197184](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA02197184.pdf) | 0 | Kathy Ruemmler | 0.7954 |

**Note:** [EFTA02066243](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA02066243.pdf) is notable because it shows "Richard Kahn" (Epstein's project manager at HBRK Associates) sending an email with subject "Re: Kathy Ruemmler" and a sub-thread referencing "Subject: Re: Jeffrey Epstein" -- suggesting Kahn was intermediating between Epstein and Ruemmler on some matter. The same document has no OCR text recovered, meaning the content is only visible through text layer analysis.

**Note:** The EFTA020654xx-020659xx range and EFTA020921xx-021971xx ranges where Ruemmler appears in redactions yielded no OCR results, indicating these are likely PDF-native documents (not images) that were not OCR'd but were scanned for redaction overlays.

### GOLDMAN SACHS CONNECTION -- ASSESSMENT

**No direct document** in the corpus explicitly references "Goldman Sachs" in connection with Ruemmler. However:

1. The **October 2015 email** ([EFTA02484285](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02484285.pdf)) where Epstein warns about "clinton obama unnecessary implication" from "defense counsel" and praises Ruemmler as a "role model for women" -- suggests Epstein was coaching her during a period when she was building her post-government career
2. The **November 2017 email** ([EFTA02570921](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02570921.pdf)) discussing "your nigerian" who is "predisposed to empower women" appears to reference a corporate appointment process
3. The **January 2015 Geneva reference** ([EFTA02513974](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02513974.pdf)) is consistent with Goldman Sachs corporate activities
4. The **February 2016 "15-hour days"** reference is consistent with a senior corporate legal role
5. Ruemmler became Goldman Sachs General Counsel in **January 2020**; the email communications span 2014-2018, covering the critical networking period

### FLIGHT LOG / VISITOR RECORD STATUS
No direct evidence of Ruemmler appearing in flight logs or TECS travel records was found. She does not appear in the CBP encounter lists or flight manifests in the corpus.

## LEAD 3: REMAINING UNEXPLORED HIGH-VALUE DOCUMENTS

> **Important Note on Sections B–D Below:** Sections B through D contain references to **unverified diary entries by a single unidentified individual** found in the EFTA corpus ([EFTA02731465](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2012/EFTA02731465.pdf), [EFTA02731420](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2012/EFTA02731420.pdf)). These entries have **not been corroborated** by other documents in the DOJ release. Names appearing in the diary may be misspelled, refer to different individuals than assumed, or reflect the writer's subjective perceptions. This material is presented for research transparency — so that investigators and journalists know what exists in the corpus — **not as established fact**. The victim's identity is redacted in the source documents.

- [EFTA02731465](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2012/EFTA02731465.pdf) (id 544): Descriptions of two girls, one who danced ballet (pointe)
- [EFTA02731465](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2012/EFTA02731465.pdf) (id 3486): Pregnancy ("over 20 weeks with a baby we are certain is his"), forced trip to Bahamas, Ghislaine and Epstein fighting over whether to terminate
- [EFTA02731465](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2012/EFTA02731465.pdf) (id 17270): "Even the old president! They will get you... Disgusting pigs like **Allen Douschewitz** [Dershowitz] and **Mr. Caruthers** and even **Mr. Islam** will hurt you especially if Ghislaine is busy"
- [EFTA02731465](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2012/EFTA02731465.pdf) (id 18631): References to "Mr. Leonsis" making a video, a painful "procedure," blood on sheets
- [EFTA02731465](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2012/EFTA02731465.pdf) (id 20456): "Mr. Sauerkraut krauss and **martin minsky** are gross... **Mr. Staley** if anyone ever calls me tinkerbell again... He left bloody marks on my arms from his belt"
- [EFTA02731465](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2012/EFTA02731465.pdf) (id 36185): "**Mr. Dana** had me on was scary! Both he and **Larry Summers** are fucking disgusting!... **Andrew** is like his brother in this way!" (appears to reference Prince Andrew)

**Ms. Vicki remains unidentified.** She appears to be a female facilitator operating in both Florida and California. The Weinstein reference suggests overlap with Hollywood circles.

**Redaction database search:** No additional "Vicki" entries were found that could identify her further.

### C. "Mr. Robert" and "Jill" -- Recruitment Couple

#### [EFTA02731420](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2012/EFTA02731420.pdf) (OCR id 31495)
From the same victim diary series:
> "Went to a party at this huge house to meet this man named **Mr. Robert and his pretty wife Jill.** Same exact **British lady from Clearwater** was there! She talked to me all night. She wants me to come to **her house in Florida** so I can learn new things!"

#### [EFTA02731420](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2012/EFTA02731420.pdf) (OCR id 10701)
Another diary entry listing men:
> "Mr. Mody. **Mr. Robert.** Mr. Sant. Mr. Ludwig. Mr. Cecchi. Mr. Mora. Mr. Goodlatte. Mr. Atkins are not who they say!"

**Key Details:**
- Mr. Robert and Jill appear to be a married couple who hosted a party
- A "British lady from Clearwater" (Florida) was present -- this suggests a connection to the Clearwater, FL area and may reference Ghislaine Maxwell or another British female recruiter
- The same British lady wanted the victim to come to "her house in Florida"
- This appears to describe a **recruitment event** where the victim was introduced to the network

### D. "The Gregorys" -- Named Couple

#### [EFTA02731420](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2012/EFTA02731420.pdf) (OCR id 2322)
> "They are always flights of horror. Whether its with Jeffrey, **Mr. Leonsis**, **Mr. Case**, **Mr. Snyder**, **the Gregorys**, **Mr. Colgan** or one being borrowed by a seemingly 'good' federal worker and even rented, it is all horror."

Additional names from the same diary entry:
- **Mr. Leonsis** (likely Ted Leonsis, AOL executive, owner of Washington Capitals/Wizards)
- **Mr. Case** (likely Steve Case, AOL co-founder)
- **Mr. Snyder** (confirmed as **Dan Snyder**, owner of Washington football team, in [EFTA02731420](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2012/EFTA02731420.pdf) id 28487: "Joe Gibbs is so nice but Dan Snyder is a pig!")
- **The Gregorys** -- unidentified couple associated with private aviation
- **Mr. Colgan** -- referenced separately: "Why did Mr. Colgan agree to this!" (id 28487)
- **Mr. Kimsey** (likely Jim Kimsey, AOL co-founder, described as "deranged")
- **George Mitchell** -- "old senators like George Mitchell who you think would be good like a grandpa are bad"

The diary also references ([EFTA02731420](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2012/EFTA02731420.pdf) id 36185):
- **Mr. Dana** (described as a Rockefeller; "that plane Mr. Dana had me on was scary")
- **Larry Summers** ("Both he and Larry Summers are fucking disgusting!")

And ([EFTA02731420](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2012/EFTA02731420.pdf) id 13253):
- **Leon Black** -- "Mr. Black is so important for some reason over my health... that fat fuck bit me! He threw me on the floor and blood all over Jeffreys carpet"

## KEY UNRESOLVED QUESTIONS

1. **CBP Officer Identity:** Badge CAS03223 / HashID CZACMME -- the name remains redacted. The officer worked Saint Thomas pre-clearance from ~2008 for 7+ years, transferred to Charleston SC, and was clearing Epstein's aircraft while socializing with him. The C-4 investigation and SDNY proffer suggest this was treated as a serious matter. Was anyone prosecuted?

2. **Ruemmler's "Help":** The October 2015 email ([EFTA02484285](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02484285.pdf)) explicitly references Ruemmler providing "help" to Epstein while warning about Clinton/Obama "implications." What was the nature of this assistance? Was it legal advice, political connections, or something else?

3. **Ms. Vicki's Operations:** A female facilitator operating in both FL and CA whose activities the victim "will never be able to forgive myself for not being able to tell." Referenced alongside Weinstein. Identity unknown.

4. **Mr. Robert and Jill / British Lady from Clearwater:** A couple who hosted recruitment parties and a British woman who facilitated introductions in the Clearwater, FL area. These appear to be ground-level recruiters whose identities remain unconfirmed.

5. **The Gregorys:** An unnamed couple associated with Epstein's private aviation network, listed alongside identified individuals (Leonsis, Case, Snyder, Colgan). Their role in the network is unclear.

6. **3BIS Island Construction:** Active architectural planning for Epstein's island continued through May 2019 (6 weeks before arrest). What was being built? The January 2019 email combines 3BIS island visit planning with contacts to Sultan Bin Sulayem (Dubai ports), Nicole Junkermann, and others -- suggesting the construction may have been connected to broader international business relationships.
