## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Between June and October 2017, Jeffrey Epstein received $30,510,961 from the sale of fine art through Sotheby's and Christie's, deposited into The Haze Trust Checking account at Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas. These funds were then systematically moved through a layered network of Epstein-controlled accounts -- first to the Haze Trust DBAGNY (Deutsche Bank AG New York branch, offering higher interest rates), then downstream to Southern Financial LLC, Southern Trust Company Inc., Plan D LLC, and ultimately to external hedge funds, venture capital funds, and investment vehicles including Peter Thiel's Valar Fund ($28.8M total across all Epstein entities), Honeycomb Partners ($64M total), Boothbay Fund ($38.25M total), Coatue Enterprises LLC ($2M -- Richard Kahn's personal shell, not Philippe Laffont's hedge fund), and Blockchain Capital ($15M to The 2017 Caterpillar Trust).

This document traces every dollar from auction house to final known destination.

## THE HAZE TRUST ACCOUNT STRUCTURE

The Haze Trust maintained THREE accounts at Deutsche Bank, all under RM CODE 82289, managed by bankers Jj Litchford and Paul Morris ([EFTA01359500](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01359500.pdf)):

| Account | Type | Bank Entity | Purpose |
|---------|------|-------------|---------|
| Haze Trust Checking | Deposit account | Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas | Primary operating account |
| Haze Trust DBAGNY | Deposit account | Deutsche Bank AG New York branch | Higher interest parking account |
| Haze Trust Brokerage | Brokerage account | Deutsche Bank | Securities/investment account |

**[EFTA00027019](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00027019.pdf) footnote states:** "The Haze Trust DBAGNY account was opened with Deutsche Bank's New York branch office. The latter account offers higher interest rates than the former. We have yet to determine how the Haze Trust Brokerage account was initially capitalized."

**Balance snapshots confirm massive holdings:**
- 06/21/2018: Haze Trust balance = $49,460,098.13 ([EFTA01381246](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01381246.pdf))
- 08/17/2018: Haze Trust (checking) = $2,503,667.84; Haze Trust (DBAGNY) = $40,583,100.79 ([EFTA01381149](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01381149.pdf))
- Various 2018 snapshots show balance fluctuating between $21M and $49.4M ([EFTA01414998](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01414998.pdf), [EFTA01415009](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01415009.pdf), [EFTA01415146](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01415146.pdf), [EFTA01415190](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01415190.pdf), [EFTA01427435](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01427435.pdf))

## CHAIN 1: CHRISTIE'S AUCTION PROCEEDS -- $7,725,000

**SOURCE:** Christie's Inc. -- art auction proceeds from sale of Epstein-controlled artwork
**ENTRY POINT:** 6/19/2017 -- $7,725,000 -- Christie's Inc. --> The Haze Trust Checking (BATES: DB-SDNY-0006320, EFTA: [EFTA00027019](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00027019.pdf) p.7)

### Downstream Path:

--> STEP 1: 6/19/2017 | $7,725,000 | Christie's Inc. --> Haze Trust Checking ([EFTA00027019](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00027019.pdf), DB-SDNY-0006320)

These funds entered the Haze Trust Checking account on June 19, 2017. The next documented outbound movement from Haze Trust Checking was:

--> STEP 2: 9/26/2017 | $15,000,000 | Haze Trust Checking --> Haze Trust DBAGNY ([EFTA00027019](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00027019.pdf), DB-SDNY-0006565)

The $15M transfer on 9/26/2017 (one day after the first Sotheby's payment) demonstrates that the Christie's proceeds ($7.725M) were commingled with other funds and moved as part of a larger $15M block to the DBAGNY parking account.

**DESTINATION:** Haze Trust DBAGNY account, then downstream via 2018-2019 transfers to Southern Financial LLC (see Chain 4)

**PROSECUTORIAL SIGNIFICANCE:** Art auction proceeds from one of the world's most prestigious auction houses were deposited into an account belonging to a convicted sex offender's trust, then rapidly moved to an offshore-style higher-interest parking account at the same bank. Deutsche Bank's compliance apparatus (documented via SAM Alert #1788880, [EFTA01369019](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01369019.pdf)) flagged these movements but the bank continued servicing the accounts.

**EVIDENCE GAPS:** Specific artwork sold through Christie's on this date not identified in [EFTA00027019](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00027019.pdf). The lot sheet and consignment agreement would establish what was sold and on whose behalf.

---

## CHAIN 2: SOTHEBY'S FIRST PAYMENT -- $11,536,544

**SOURCE:** Sotheby's -- art auction proceeds
**ENTRY POINT:** 9/25/2017 -- $11,536,544 -- Sotheby's --> The Haze Trust Checking (BATES: DB-SDNY-0006565, EFTA: [EFTA00027019](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00027019.pdf) p.7)

### Downstream Path:

--> STEP 1: 9/25/2017 | $11,536,544 | Sotheby's --> Haze Trust Checking ([EFTA00027019](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00027019.pdf), DB-SDNY-0006565)
--> STEP 2: 9/26/2017 | $15,000,000 | Haze Trust Checking --> Haze Trust DBAGNY ([EFTA00027019](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00027019.pdf), DB-SDNY-0006565)

**CRITICAL TIMING:** The $15M transfer to DBAGNY occurred THE VERY NEXT DAY after the Sotheby's payment arrived. The $11.5M Sotheby's payment plus remaining Christie's proceeds ($7.725M deposited 3 months earlier, minus any interim spending) were swept immediately into the higher-interest DBAGNY account. This is a same-BATES-reference pairing, meaning both transactions appear on the same bank statement page (DB-SDNY-0006565).

**DESTINATION:** Haze Trust DBAGNY --> Southern Financial LLC (2018-2019 transfers, see Chain 4)

**PROSECUTORIAL SIGNIFICANCE:** Next-day sweeping of $11.5M in auction proceeds directly into a parking account demonstrates deliberate asset management. The same-day pairing on BATES DB-SDNY-0006565 proves the receiving bank statement captured both the deposit and the immediate transfer.

**EVIDENCE GAPS:** Specific Sotheby's lots from September 2017 sales not identified. Private Client Group handler Lily Snyder ([EFTA02323094](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02323094.pdf)) managed Epstein's Sotheby's accounts.

---

## CHAIN 3: SOTHEBY'S SECOND PAYMENT -- $11,249,417

**SOURCE:** Sotheby's -- art auction proceeds
**ENTRY POINT:** 10/24/2017 -- $11,249,417 -- Sotheby's --> The Haze Trust Checking (BATES: DB-SDNY-0006646, EFTA: [EFTA00027019](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00027019.pdf) p.7)

### Downstream Path:

--> STEP 1: 10/24/2017 | $11,249,417 | Sotheby's --> Haze Trust Checking ([EFTA00027019](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00027019.pdf), DB-SDNY-0006646)
--> STEP 2: 10/26/2017 | $13,000,000 | Haze Trust Checking --> Haze Trust DBAGNY ([EFTA00027019](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00027019.pdf), DB-SDNY-0006646)

**CRITICAL TIMING:** Two days after the second Sotheby's payment arrived, $13M was swept to the DBAGNY account. Again, the same BATES reference (DB-SDNY-0006646) captures both the incoming auction payment and the outgoing parking transfer on the same statement.

**DESTINATION:** Haze Trust DBAGNY --> Southern Financial LLC (2018-2019, see Chain 4)

**PROSECUTORIAL SIGNIFICANCE:** Three auction payments totaling $30.5M followed the identical pattern: deposit into checking, sweep within 1-2 days to DBAGNY. The $13M outbound (slightly more than the $11.25M received) indicates other funds were commingled, but the pattern demonstrates systematic laundering of art proceeds through the trust structure.

**EVIDENCE GAPS:** Same as Chain 2.

---

## CHAIN 4: HAZE TRUST DBAGNY TO SOUTHERN FINANCIAL LLC -- THE GREAT DRAIN (2018-2019)

**SOURCE:** Haze Trust DBAGNY -- accumulated art auction proceeds and other funds
**TOTAL OUTFLOW TO SOUTHERN FINANCIAL:** $48,291,283 (documented transfers)

This chain traces where the auction proceeds went AFTER being parked in the DBAGNY account.

### Complete Transfer Schedule: Haze Trust --> Southern Financial LLC

| Date | Amount | From | To | BATES | EFTA |
|------|--------|------|----|-------|------|
| 6/22/2018 | $9,000,000 | Haze Trust DBAGNY | Southern Financial LLC Checking | DB-SDNY-0007361 | [EFTA00027019](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00027019.pdf) p.7 |

| 2/7/2019 | $8,791,283 | Haze Trust Checking | Southern Financial LLC Checking | DB-SDNY-0008063 | [EFTA00027019](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00027019.pdf) p.7 |
| **TOTAL** | **$48,291,283** | | | | |

### Additional Haze Trust Outflows (Non-Southern Financial):

| Date | Amount | From | To | BATES | EFTA |
|------|--------|------|----|-------|------|
| 10/1/2018 | $10,000,000 | Haze Trust DBAGNY | Southern Trust Company Checking | DB-SDNY-0007725 | [EFTA00027019](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00027019.pdf) p.7 |
| 2/22/2019 | $24,564,037 | Haze Trust Checking | Southern Financial LLC Checking | DB-SDNY-0008063 | [EFTA00027019](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00027019.pdf) p.7 |
| 2/22/2019 | $7,000,000 | Haze Trust Checking | Jeffrey Epstein Checking | DB-SDNY-0008063 | [EFTA00027019](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00027019.pdf) p.7 |

### February 2019 "Dissolution Event"

On February 19 and 22, 2019, a massive multi-directional transfer event occurred:

--> 2/19/2019 | $12,608,253 | Haze Trust Brokerage --> Haze Trust Checking (DB-SDNY-0008064)
--> 2/19/2019 | $167,414 | Haze Trust Brokerage --> Haze Trust Checking (DB-SDNY-0008064)
--> 2/19/2019 | $11,715,364 | Southern Financial LLC Checking --> Haze Trust Checking (DB-SDNY-0008063)
--> 2/19/2019 | $7,000,000 | Jeffrey Epstein Checking --> Haze Trust Checking (DB-SDNY-0008063)
--> 2/22/2019 | $7,000,000 | Haze Trust Checking --> Jeffrey Epstein Checking (DB-SDNY-0008063)
--> 2/22/2019 | $24,564,037 | Haze Trust Checking --> Southern Financial LLC Checking (DB-SDNY-0008063)

**INTERPRETATION:** On Feb 19, funds flowed INTO Haze Trust from three sources ($31.5M total: brokerage liquidation + Southern Financial return + Epstein personal). On Feb 22, funds flowed OUT ($31.5M: $24.56M to Southern Financial + $7M back to Epstein). This was a trust consolidation-and-redistribution event, occurring approximately 5 months before Epstein's July 2019 arrest. The round-trip of $7M from/to Epstein Checking and $11.7M from/to Southern Financial suggests a deliberate restructuring of which entity held which assets.

**PROSECUTORIAL SIGNIFICANCE:** The Haze Trust was being systematically drained from mid-2018 onward. Post-KYC breach data (POST_KYC_REPEAT_CORRIDORS_v2.csv) confirms the Haze Trust DBAGNY to Southern Financial LLC corridor carried $22M in just 3 post-KYC transactions (6/22/2018 through 9/28/2018). The Feb 2019 dissolution event restructured $31.5M in a single weekend -- five months before arrest. This timing suggests pre-arrest asset repositioning.

**EVIDENCE GAPS:** We do not have Southern Financial LLC's own bank statements showing where these funds went after receipt. The corridor is one-way visible only.

## CHAIN 5: HAZE TRUST DBAGNY TO PLAN D, LLC -- $15,000,000 (AIRCRAFT PURCHASES)

**SOURCE:** Haze Trust DBAGNY -- funds originating from Haze Trust Brokerage liquidation
**DESTINATION:** Plan D, LLC -- Epstein's aircraft holding company

### Transaction:

--> STEP 1: 3/10/2017 | $36,000,000 | Haze Trust Brokerage --> Haze Trust Checking (DB-SDNY-0006153, [EFTA00027019](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00027019.pdf) p.7)
--> STEP 2: 3/10/2017 | $35,999,000 | Haze Trust Checking --> Haze Trust DBAGNY (DB-SDNY-0006153, [EFTA00027019](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00027019.pdf) p.7)
--> STEP 3: 3/27/2017 | $15,000,000 | Haze Trust DBAGNY --> Plan D, LLC Checking (DB-SDNY-0006168, [EFTA00027019](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00027019.pdf) p.7)

**WHAT IS PLAN D, LLC?**

Plan D, LLC is a USVI limited liability company (6100 Red Hook Quarter, B3, St. Thomas, USVI 00802) that served as Epstein's aircraft holding entity. Key facts from the documentary record:

- **Original Articles of Organization** (filed 10/19/2012): Larry Visoski (Epstein's pilot) listed as sole manager/member ([EFTA00018778](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00018778.pdf) -- GVI First Amended Complaint)
- **July 31, 2019 Annual Report** revealed Epstein as the actual principal behind Plan D, LLC ([EFTA00018778](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00018778.pdf))
- **Aircraft owned:** Gulfstream G550, serial #5173, registered as N415LM then re-registered as N212JE ([EFTA00010620](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00010620.pdf), [EFTA00011531](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00011531.pdf), [EFTA00037857](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00037857.pdf))
- **FAA Bill of Sale:** March 2017 transfer to Plan D, LLC for $1.00 ([EFTA00037857](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00037857.pdf))
- **Sikorsky S-76C-2 helicopter** (serial 760750): Originally registered to "Air Ghislaine Inc" (renamed to "Shmitka Air Inc" in 2010), later transferred to Hyperion Air LLC -- a parallel Epstein aircraft entity ([EFTA00021675](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00021675.pdf))
- **Post-death disposition:** 12/22/2020, Lawrence Visoski on behalf of Plan D LLC "sold" N212JE to Six G Aviation LLC, same-day transfer to NSSOGP LLC ([EFTA00023437](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00023437.pdf))
- **Deutsche Bank account officers:** Same Jj Litchford/Paul Morris team managing all Epstein entities ([EFTA01359500](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01359500.pdf))
- **Balance as of 8/17/2018:** Plan D, LLC checking = $326,685.34 ([EFTA01381149](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01381149.pdf))

### Additional Plan D, LLC Capital Flows (from BV70 LLC / Leon Black):

| Date | Amount | From | To | BATES | EFTA |
|------|--------|------|----|-------|------|
| 3/31/2017 | $22,500,000 | BV70 LLC | Plan D, LLC | DB-SDNY-0006113 | [EFTA00027019](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00027019.pdf) p.1 |
| 4/17/2017 | $8,000,000 | BV70 LLC | Plan D, LLC | DB-SDNY-0006197 | [EFTA00027019](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00027019.pdf) p.1 |
| 10/2/2018 | $10,000,000 | Plan D, LLC | BV 70th LLC | DB-SDNY-0007669 | [EFTA00027019](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00027019.pdf) p.1 |
| **NET BV70 --> Plan D** | **$20,500,000** | | | | |

**TOTAL PLAN D CAPITALIZATION:** $15M (Haze Trust) + $30.5M (BV70/Leon Black) = $45.5M, with $10M returned to BV70

**PROSECUTORIAL SIGNIFICANCE:** Plan D, LLC held the aircraft used to transport victims between properties (Teterboro-PBI-USVI route documented in flight logs). The $15M from Haze Trust to Plan D was art auction proceeds being converted into transportation infrastructure for trafficking. BV70 LLC (controlled by Leon Black, per Bloomberg reporting cited in [EFTA00027019](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00027019.pdf) footnote) contributed an additional $30.5M to the same aircraft entity, meaning Leon Black money and art proceeds were commingled in the aircraft fleet.

**EVIDENCE GAPS:** No direct evidence that Plan D used the $15M specifically for the G550 purchase (the FAA bill of sale shows $1.00 nominal price, suggesting the actual purchase was structured differently). **BV70 ownership now confirmed (DS9):** [EFTA00599517](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00599517.pdf) shows "BV70 LLC Member: Leon D. Black, Manager: Debra R. Black, Officers: President: Debra R. Black, Vice President: Leon D. Black, Secretary and Treasurer: Eileen Alexanderson." Complete promissory note chain: BV70 lent $30.5M to Plan D ([EFTA00589279](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00589279.pdf)), personally guaranteed by Epstein ([EFTA00583120](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00583120.pdf)). The $30.5M note amount matches the $30.5M in art auction proceeds.

## CHAIN 6: SOUTHERN FINANCIAL LLC TO INVESTMENT FUNDS -- DOWNSTREAM DISTRIBUTION

Southern Financial LLC served as Epstein's primary investment vehicle. After receiving $48.3M+ from Haze Trust (Chain 4) and $24.6M in the Feb 2019 dissolution, Southern Financial distributed funds to the following external entities:

### 6A: Southern Financial LLC --> Boothbay Funds (TOTAL: $38,250,000)

| Date | Amount | From | To | BATES | EFTA |
|------|--------|------|----|-------|------|
| 5/2/2014 | $10,000,000 | Southern Financial LLC | Boothbay Multi Strategy Fund LP | DB-SDNY-0003845 | [EFTA00027019](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00027019.pdf) p.2 |

**NOTE:** The Jan 2017 $10M return from Boothbay was received BEFORE the 2017 auction payments, suggesting it may have been reinvested elsewhere. The round-trip nature of the $10M (out May 2014, back Jan 2017) raises questions about whether this was genuine investment or wash trading.

| **TOTAL** | **$28,800,000** | | | | |

**Fund II subtotal:** $6,300,000 (5 transactions, 2015)
**Fund III subtotal:** $22,500,000 (11 transactions, 2016-2019)

**NOTE:** The payments routed through Southern TRUST Company (not Southern Financial LLC). Southern Trust Company Inc. was a separate Epstein entity, also managed by Litchford/Morris at Deutsche Bank ([EFTA01359500](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01359500.pdf)). The 10/11/2017 payment of $2.25M to Valar came just 17 days after the $11.5M Sotheby's auction payment to Haze Trust. While the transfer route was Haze Trust DBAGNY --> (parked) --> Southern Trust --> Valar, the temporal proximity is notable.

**PROSECUTORIAL SIGNIFICANCE:** Peter Thiel's Valar Ventures received $28.8M from Epstein entities over 4+ years. The payments accelerated in 2017 (coinciding with the art auction proceeds) and continued through April 2019 -- three months before arrest. Post-KYC breach (April 2018+), $5.75M still flowed to Valar across 3 transactions.

### 6C: Southern Trust Company --> Honeycomb Partners/Ventures (TOTAL: $54,000,000 + $10M via Caterpillar Trust)

| Date | Amount | From | To | BATES | EFTA |
|------|--------|------|----|-------|------|

| **TOTAL** | **$64,000,000** | | | | |

**Post-KYC breach (April 2018+):** $33M across 4 transactions from Southern Trust + $10M from Caterpillar Trust = $43M post-breach.

**PROSECUTORIAL SIGNIFICANCE:** Honeycomb was the single largest external recipient of Epstein entity funds documented in Exhibit B. The $20M in 2016 predates the auction payments, but the 2018-2019 payments ($33M from Southern Trust alone) occurred during the period when auction proceeds were being drained from Haze Trust through Southern Financial and then onward. The $33M post-KYC figure matches POST_KYC_REPEAT_CORRIDORS_v2.csv data showing this as the largest repeat post-breach corridor.

### 6D: Southern Financial LLC --> Coatue Enterprises LLC (Richard Kahn) (TOTAL: $2,000,000)

**CORRECTION (2026-02-12):** GVI Second Amended Complaint ([EFTA00161836](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00161836.pdf) p.58) explicitly states: "Coatue Enterprises, LLC (Kahn)" -- this was Richard Kahn's personal shell company, NOT Philippe Laffont's tech hedge fund. The entity "functioned as shell companies and engaged in no activities other than to coordinate the activities of Epstein's Enterprise." Portfolio valuation ([EFTA00599617](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00599617.pdf) p.6) lists Coatue Enterprises LLC under "Loans Receivable" at $1.5M alongside personal loans to Epstein employees. Trust instruments name it as beneficially owned by Richard David Kahn and Lisa Kahn. Philippe Laffont's Coatue Management received $0 from Epstein entities in the documented record.

| **TOTAL** | **$2,000,000** | | | | |

**PROSECUTORIAL SIGNIFICANCE:** Quarterly $500K payments to Kahn's personal shell were likely compensation/debt servicing for accounting work, not hedge fund investments. This removes Laffont entirely from the transaction chain and reduces the number of external investment fund recipients. Two of four payments occurred post-KYC breach.

**NOTE:** These payments preceded the 2017 auction receipts but demonstrate the downstream distribution pattern. Joichi Ito, then-director of MIT Media Lab, resigned in 2019 when these payments were exposed.

**DS9 CONFIRMATION:** Kyara Investments III LLC Operating Agreement ([EFTA00584696](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00584696.pdf)) confirms Joichi Ito as Manager and Southern Financial LLC (Jeffrey Epstein, Manager) as member. Wire details: "subcr to Kyara Investments III, LLC to fund Blockstream Investment" and "subcr to Kyara Investment IV, LLC to fund OH2 Laboratories." OH2 Laboratories was an MIT-connected biotech startup (GPCRQTY synthetic protein variants, drug discovery), with David Levy (Ph.D.) as General Manager and Shuguang Zhang (MIT) on Scientific Advisory Board ([EFTA00586577](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00586577.pdf)). Blockstream relationship was personal -- co-founder Austin Hill visited 9 E 71st, attended Montreal comedy shows with Epstein ([EFTA00366248](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00366248.pdf), [EFTA00638276](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00638276.pdf)).

Blockchain Capital returns flowed in, then $10M went out to Honeycomb Ventures IV -- a different Honeycomb entity from the one receiving from Southern Trust.

This links Southern Financial to cryptocurrency (Blockstream) and scientific research (OH2) investments.

## CHAIN 7: HAZE TRUST DBAGNY TO SOUTHERN TRUST COMPANY -- $10,000,000

**SOURCE:** Haze Trust DBAGNY -- auction proceeds and accumulated funds

--> STEP 1: 10/1/2018 | $10,000,000 | Haze Trust DBAGNY --> Southern Trust Company Checking (DB-SDNY-0007725, [EFTA00027019](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00027019.pdf) p.7)

Southern Trust Company Inc. then distributed to:
- Valar Fund III LP (see Chain 6B above)
- Honeycomb Partners LP (see Chain 6C above)

**PROSECUTORIAL SIGNIFICANCE:** This establishes a direct Haze Trust --> Southern Trust Company pipeline, from which funds immediately flowed to Valar (Peter Thiel) and Honeycomb. The Southern Trust Company was the "clean" intermediary -- same bank, same relationship managers, but a different legal entity name.

## CHAIN 8: LEON BLACK / BV70 LLC CAPITALIZATION OF PLAN D AND GRATITUDE AMERICA

Gratitude America then distributed to: Bruce and Marsha Moskowitz Foundation, Melanoma Research Alliance Foundation, Cancer Research Wellness Institute, NPO Baleto Teatras (Lithuanian ballet), VSJ Baleto Teatras, and internal transfers. Total documented outflow from Gratitude America MMDA: approximately $8.5M+ across 2016-2019.

**PROSECUTORIAL SIGNIFICANCE:** BV70 LLC is identified as Leon Black-controlled (Bloomberg reporting, cited in [EFTA00027019](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00027019.pdf) footnote). Black's money funded both the aircraft fleet (Plan D, used for victim transport) and the philanthropic cover (Gratitude America, used for reputation laundering). The $10M return from Plan D to "BV 70th LLC" in October 2018 (note the variant name -- [EFTA00027019](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00027019.pdf) itself flags this discrepancy) suggests asset recapture as legal pressure mounted.

**GRAND TOTAL Leon Black --> Epstein Entities (Exhibit A):** $106.5M (direct) + $20M (Narrow Holdings) + $30.5M (BV70 to Plan D) + $10M (BV70 to Gratitude America) = **$167,000,000**

**NOTE:** The Apollo Conflicts Committee report ([EFTA02730996](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2012/EFTA02730996.pdf)) characterizes Black's total payments as approximately $158M. The discrepancy may reflect that the $10M BV70-->Gratitude America payment was classified differently, or that some payments were netted.

## CHAIN 10: HAZE TRUST INCOMING FROM HSBC BERMUDA

--> 12/13/2018 | $58,328 | HSBC Bank Bermuda Limited --> The Haze Trust Checking (DB-SDNY-0007888, [EFTA00027019](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00027019.pdf) p.7)

**PROSECUTORIAL SIGNIFICANCE:** This small payment from HSBC Bermuda establishes an international banking connection. The Haze Trust was receiving funds from offshore jurisdictions (Bermuda) in addition to the domestic auction house payments. This suggests broader international financial activity than the auction chain alone.

## ACCOUNT BALANCE TIMELINE (FROM RM CODE 82289 SNAPSHOTS)

These Deutsche Bank internal balance reports confirm the flows:

| Date | Haze Trust (Checking) | Haze Trust (DBAGNY) | Southern Financial | EFTA |

**KEY OBSERVATION:** The Haze Trust DBAGNY balance dropped from ~$49.4M (June 2018) to ~$40.5M (Aug 2018) to ~$21M (early 2019) -- a decline of ~$28M that matches the documented transfers to Southern Financial LLC. Southern Financial's balance fluctuated rapidly (from $532K to $7M and back to $534K), confirming it was a pass-through entity, not a long-term holding account.

## DEUTSCHE BANK COMPLIANCE FAILURES

The Haze Trust was the subject of Deutsche Bank's SAM Alert #1788880 ([EFTA01369019](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01369019.pdf)), triggering an AML investigation chain involving:
- Vahe Stepanian
- Donald Summer
- Cynthia Rodriguez
- Joshua Shoshan
- Zbynek Kozelsky
- Stewart Oldfield
- Cherie Quigley
- AMLCompliance Inquiries team

Despite this alert, documented in 50+ email communications across [EFTA01357853](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01357853.pdf) through [EFTA01423476](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01423476.pdf), the bank:
1. Continued processing transfers from the Haze Trust DBAGNY to Southern Financial LLC totaling $48.3M
2. Processed the Feb 2019 dissolution transfers totaling $31.5M+
3. Never closed the accounts until after Epstein's arrest

Deutsche Bank internal reports show "URGENT - THIRD REQUEST!!!!!" escalations ([EFTA01414241](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01414241.pdf)) and admissions that "kyc is not happening" ([EFTA01362456](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01362456.pdf)), yet $189M in post-KYC-breach transactions continued flowing.

## SUMMARY OF COMPLETE DOWNSTREAM DESTINATIONS

Starting from $30,510,961 in auction proceeds:

| Destination | Total Amount | Entity Type | Post-2017? |
|-------------|-------------|-------------|------------|
| Haze Trust DBAGNY (parking) | $28,000,000 | Internal transfer | Yes |
| Southern Financial LLC | $48,291,283 | Epstein investment vehicle | Yes |
| Southern Trust Company | $10,000,000 | Epstein trust company | Yes |
| Plan D, LLC | $15,000,000 | Aircraft holding (pre-auction) | Pre-auction |
| --> Valar Fund (Thiel) | $28,800,000 | Venture capital | Partially |
| --> Honeycomb Partners | $64,000,000 | Investment fund | Partially |
| --> Boothbay Funds | $38,250,000 | Hedge fund | Pre-auction |
| --> Coatue Enterprises (Kahn) | $2,000,000 | Kahn personal shell (not hedge fund) | Partially |
| --> Joichi Ito/Neoteny | $2,000,001 | MIT/VC | Pre-auction |
| --> Blockchain/Caterpillar | $15,000,000 | Crypto investment | Post-auction |
| Jeffrey Epstein personal | $7,000,000 | Personal accounts | Yes |

**CRITICAL CAVEAT:** Because Epstein's entities operated as a commingled pool, it is impossible to trace specific auction dollars to specific downstream payments. However, the $30.5M in auction proceeds entered the Haze Trust pool that, in aggregate, funded all the above destinations. The temporal proximity (auction proceeds in 2017, drain to Southern Financial in 2018-2019, concurrent payments to Valar/Honeycomb/Coatue) establishes that auction proceeds were part of the funding stream for these investments.

---

## EVIDENCE GAPS AND INVESTIGATIVE LEADS

1. **Missing Southern Financial LLC statements:** We can see money entering Southern Financial from Haze Trust, but Southern Financial's own disbursements to external parties are documented only through Exhibit B (which uses Southern Trust Company as the payer for Valar/Honeycomb). The internal pipeline from Southern Financial to Southern Trust Company is not documented in Exhibit D.

2. **Art lot identification -- PARTIALLY FILLED (DS9):** Sarah Kellen was the active intermediary handling Epstein art consignments to Sotheby's Private Client Group through Lily Snyder ([EFTA00563811](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00563811.pdf), [EFTA00556342](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00556342.pdf)). Pipeline active from at least 2011-2017. Items discussed include Syrian pearl inlay furniture, bronze mounted desks, lamps, and watercolors. The $30.5M in 2017 auction proceeds likely came through this established Kellen-Snyder channel. Leon Black's art collection management ([EFTA02730996](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2012/EFTA02730996.pdf) -- Epstein "managed Black's art") also suggests these may have been from the Black/Epstein co-managed collection.

3. **Missing DBAGNY account detail:** The DBAGNY account offered "higher interest rates" but we have no statements showing interest earned on the $49M+ balances.

4. **Honeycomb Partners identity -- PARTIAL (DS9):** David Fiszel (previously Tiger Global, then Honeycomb Asset Management) met Epstein on the same day as Peter Thiel, Leon Black, Paul Morris, and Ehud Barak (Feb 4, 2016, [EFTA00329762](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00329762.pdf)). Fiszel visited 9 E 71st in April 2019 with "new idea almost ready for prime time" ([EFTA00492527](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00492527.pdf)). Honeycomb counsel (Gibson Dunn) contacted SDNY post-arrest about "holding funds for entities linked to Epstein and Richard Kahn" ([EFTA00068100](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00068100.pdf)). Beneficial ownership still not definitively confirmed.

5. **February 2019 dissolution motivation:** The mass restructuring 5 months before arrest warrants investigation. Did Epstein have advance knowledge of the investigation? The round-trip transactions suggest deliberate asset repositioning.

6. **HSBC Bermuda connection:** The $58,328 from HSBC Bank Bermuda suggests offshore accounts not captured in the Deutsche Bank records.

7. **Banking relationships far broader than Deutsche Bank (DS9):** July 2017 portfolio valuation ([EFTA00599617](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00599617.pdf)) reveals accounts at 7+ institutions: Deutsche Bank, First Bank Puerto Rico, BNP Paribas, Wells Fargo, Morgan Stanley, Merrill Lynch, and Ameritrade. Total cash across all banks: ~$136M.

8. **King Street Capital -- NEW (DS9):** Previously undocumented hedge fund investment. Haze Trust held $3.6M with King Street as of July 2017 ([EFTA00599617](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00599617.pdf)). King Street Capital is a distressed debt fund (now part of Citadel).

9. **Apollo stock conflict (DS9):** Epstein held Apollo Global Management stock in Southern Financial LLC's Deutsche Bank account ([EFTA00617222](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00617222.pdf) p.4) while simultaneously receiving $158M+ in personal payments from Leon Black (Apollo's founder).

10. **Complete portfolio snapshot July 2017 (DS9):** Total assets ~$456M: Cash $136M, Fixed Income $74M, Equities $74M (including $46.7M Apple stock), Hedge Funds $73M (Boothbay $45.7M, King Street $3.6M), Investments $58M, Aviation/Auto/Boats $27M, Loans Receivable $11.2M (including $4.75M to Indyke via Harlequin Dane LLC and $1.5M to Kahn via Coatue Enterprises LLC). ([EFTA00599617](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00599617.pdf))

7. **Tudor Futures Fund:** Paul Tudor Jones's fund sent $13.5M TO Southern Financial (8/4/2014 and 8/8/2014) -- this is investment RETURN money, but the original investment from Southern Financial to Tudor is not documented in the exhibits.

8. **Kyara/Blockstream/OH2 -- FILLED (DS9):** Kyara III Operating Agreement confirms Ito-Epstein dual management ([EFTA00584696](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00584696.pdf)). OH2 Laboratories identified as MIT biotech startup ([EFTA00586577](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00586577.pdf)). Blockstream co-founder Austin Hill had personal relationship with Epstein.

---

## PROSECUTORIAL CONCLUSION

The $30,510,961 in art auction proceeds from Sotheby's and Christie's entered the Haze Trust in 2017 and were immediately parked in the DBAGNY higher-interest account. Over the following 20 months, these funds -- commingled with other Epstein assets totaling approximately $49.4M -- were systematically drained through Southern Financial LLC and Southern Trust Company to external investment funds. The largest beneficiaries were Honeycomb Partners ($64M), Boothbay Funds ($38.25M), Peter Thiel's Valar Fund ($28.8M), and Blockchain Capital via the 2017 Caterpillar Trust ($15M).

The same Deutsche Bank relationship managers (Jj Litchford and Paul Morris) who managed Leon Black's personal $25M Elysium Checking account also managed every Epstein entity involved in this chain. Despite documented AML alerts, KYC failures, and "URGENT" compliance escalations, Deutsche Bank continued processing these transfers through April 2019 -- three months before Epstein's arrest.

The art-to-investment pipeline demonstrates how legitimate auction house transactions were used as entry points for a financial network that ultimately funded aircraft used for victim transport (Plan D LLC), cryptocurrency investments (Kyara/Blockstream), and venture capital deployments (Valar/Honeycomb) -- all while maintaining a veneer of sophisticated wealth management.
