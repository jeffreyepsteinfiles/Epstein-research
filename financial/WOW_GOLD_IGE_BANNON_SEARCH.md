# EXHAUSTIVE SEARCH: World of Warcraft Gold / IGE / Virtual Game Currency / Bannon-Epstein Financial Connection

**Date:** 2026-02-08
**Databases searched:** 4 (primary document text database, Dataset 10 document text database, OCR text extraction database, image catalog database)
**Total records searched:** 3,507,825 (1,808,942 + 1,629,776 + 38,955 + 29,152)

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

**FINDING: NEGATIVE.** There is **ZERO** evidence in the Epstein DOJ files that Jeffrey Epstein used World of Warcraft gold, any virtual game currency, IGE (Internet Gaming Entertainment), or any MMORPG-related mechanism to move money. There is no connection whatsoever between Epstein's financial operations and Steve Bannon's involvement with IGE/Affinity Media.

The Bannon-Epstein relationship documented in these files is significant but concerns entirely different matters: political access brokering, Trump-era Washington connections, and personal socializing (2017-2019).

### Analysis of Apparent Hits

**"WoW" hits (45 in v2, 42 in ds10):** ALL are false positives. They include:
- The word "wow" used as an exclamation in social media screenshots ("Oh wow thank you so, so much George")
- OCR garble ("wow tedex com", "wows nd niplitmli")
- Bloomberg terminal data artifacts
- None relate to the World of Warcraft video game

**"IGE" hits (126 in v2, 73 in ds10, 745 in OCR, 782 in images):** ALL are false positives matching substrings within other words:
- "intell**IGE**nce" (most common - FBI/DOJ intelligence references)
- "Don**IGE**r" (Kate L. Doniger, AUSA)
- "dil**IGE**nce" (due diligence references)
- "N**IGE**r" / "N**IGE**ria"
- "refr**IGE**rate"
- "Ig**e**lbrink" (name)
- None refer to Internet Gaming Entertainment

**"Blizzard" OCR hits (4):** All are the word "blizzard" used metaphorically in SDNY news clips: "Epstein's lawyers say they need at least a year to review a **blizzard** of documents prosecutors have gathered" ([EFTA00018466](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00018466.pdf)). Not the company Blizzard Entertainment.

**"virtual currency" hits (2 in OCR, 2 in images):** Both refer to SDNY news clips about a Bitcoin fraud case (Jon Barry Thompson/Volantis) - a totally unrelated case included in SDNY press clippings. Quote: "When a criminal's stash is in bitcoin, the stakes are now much higher in forfeiture cases with the soaring value of the virtual currency." No connection to Epstein's finances.

**"Hong Kong" + "gold" hits (9 in v2, 9 in ds10):** All are Bloomberg terminal screenshots showing financial analyst ratings with "Hong Kong" appearing as a regional office location for brokerage firms (Goldman Sachs, HSBC, etc.). "Gold" appears as part of "Goldman Sachs." No connection to gold farming or IGE's Hong Kong operations.

### Analysis of Bannon + "gold" OCR Hits

The 3 OCR hits for Bannon + gold ([EFTA00010819](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00010819.pdf), [EFTA00016268](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00016268.pdf), [EFTA00025231](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00025231.pdf)) are all false positives where "Bannon" and "gold" appear in completely unrelated contexts within the same long document (e.g., SEC/financial fraud discussion mentioning "Goldman Sachs" on the same page as a general news clip mentioning Bannon).

## PART 3: BANNON-RELATED ENTITY SEARCHES

| Search Term | v2 DB | ds10 DB | OCR DB | Image DB |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| "Breitbart" | **0** | **0** | 9 | 4 |
| "Cambridge Analytica" | 4 | 2 | 3 | N/A |
| "We Build the Wall" | 1 | 0 | N/A | N/A |
| "WBTW" | 6 | 0 | 8 | N/A |

### Breitbart References

All 9 OCR hits and 4 image hits are Breitbart.com URLs appearing in SDNY daily press clipping emails. Example: "https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2019/08/10/report-prison-guards-skipped-mandatory-checks-before-jeffrey-epsteins-death/" -- a Breitbart article about Epstein's prison guards. No Bannon operational connection.

### Cambridge Analytica References

- **[EFTA00037679](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00037679.pdf) / [EFTA01654065](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01654065.pdf):** An external email forwarded to SDNY with subject line "Cambridge Analytica / Trump / Royal Family / Epstein/Maxwell" -- appears to be a tip/conspiracy theory forwarded per standard practice. Content not fully visible.
- **[EFTA00023549](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00023549.pdf):** A Wikipedia-style screenshot about Nigel Oakes, "founder and CEO of Behavioural Dynamics Institute and SCL Group, the parent company of Cambridge Analytica." Oakes appears in context of investigators checking if he was on the "Lolita Express flight logs."

### We Build the Wall (WBTW) References

These are the most significant Bannon-Epstein connection in the files, but they relate to the SDNY prosecution overlap, not to any financial relationship:

- **[EFTA00019469](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00019469.pdf):** AUSA email: "Subject: WBTW/Epstein -- Just wanted to say that I know you've done a ton of work on both of these cases"
- **[EFTA00019603](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00019603.pdf):** Internal SDNY discussion about staffing for WBTW case
- **[EFTA00023909](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00023909.pdf):** "WBTW Motions/Letters" -- referencing Maxwell case bill of particulars as template
- **[EFTA00025014](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00025014.pdf):** Florida State Attorney Dave Aronberg called, "assuming this relates to the Epstein case (though it's possible, given the timing of the call today, that it relates to WBTW)"
- **[EFTA00029887](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00029887.pdf):** "Did the team ever do a short form memo re WBTW in case we have to send something down?"
- **[EFTA00030385](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00030385.pdf):** Duplicate of [EFTA00019469](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00019469.pdf)
- **[EFTA00031095](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00031095.pdf):** "We Build the Wall uploaded to Relativity asap to begin privilege review"

The WBTW connection is purely prosecutorial -- the same SDNY team worked on both the Epstein/Maxwell and WBTW/Bannon cases simultaneously.

## PART 4: WHAT THE FILES DO SHOW ABOUT THE BANNON-EPSTEIN RELATIONSHIP

### Documented Evidence (Chronological)

**1. October 2017 -- Bannon/Wolff/Epstein Social Circle ([EFTA02589079](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02589079.pdf))**
Michael Wolff forwarded a message from Steve Bannon to Jeffrey Epstein trying to arrange a meeting. Bannon was "in CT w/ donors to my revolution" and asked to reschedule. Wolff wrote: "JE leaves for Paris tomorrow at 9:30AM. Could meet before or tonight." Bannon responded: "Can't make tomorrow. Can we resked for when he returns." Bannon also asked Wolff: "Did u see prince in nyt and dit tweets on corker???"

**2. January 2017 -- Wolff/Epstein/Ailes ([EFTA02664993](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02664993.pdf))**

**3. February 2018 -- Bannon-Epstein Direct Texts ([EFTA02518865](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02518865.pdf), [EFTA02518873](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02518873.pdf), [EFTA02518894](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02518894.pdf))**
Direct email exchange between Steve Bannon and Jeffrey Epstein (jeevacation@gmail.com):
- **[EFTA02518865](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02518865.pdf):** Bannon asked "To have breakfast with Jared." Epstein replied: "MBS coming to wash 19th please note" -- referring to Mohammed bin Salman's visit to Washington.
- **[EFTA02518873](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02518873.pdf):** Bannon sent Epstein a NYT article "As Xi Tightens His Grip on China, US Sees Conflict Ahead"
- **[EFTA02518894](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02518894.pdf):** Extended exchange. Epstein: "Nick Ribis loyal, lawyer. Knows Donald 25 years, and shares kasowitz Expertise." Bannon: "I think hope maybe getting indicted." Epstein: "Hope gone. Donjrspittoon. I'm on cell." Bannon: "What firm." Epstein: "Nick was the person that negotiated Donald out of bankruptcy. Not Wilbur." Bannon used steve@arc-ent.com and BlackBerry.

**4. May 2018 -- Bannon-Epstein News Sharing ([EFTA02664977](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02664977.pdf))**
Steve Bannon forwarded a WSJ article to Epstein. Also copied Alexandra Preote.

**5. January 2019 -- Apple Watch Gift ([EFTA02271437](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02271437.pdf))**
Email chain about Epstein sending an Apple Watch to Bannon via FedEx to Washington. Sean Bannon (Steve's relative) wrote: "Thank you! I'll have him wear it next time he meets with [redacted]." Staff member: "Good morning Sean. Jeffrey would like to send your father an Apple Watch. He is asking me to Fed Ex to Washington."

**6. January 2019 -- Island Guest List ([EFTA02273951](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02273951.pdf))**
Epstein email from jeevacation@gmail.com about guests for island trip Feb 2-5: "also need to tell sultan. eduardo. moritz. nicole. bannon. astrid. jabor. annas." The full list of people to contact:
- Sultan Bin Sulayem
- Eduardo Teodorani
- Nicole Junkermann
- Jabor Yousuf
- Moritz (no contact details)
- **Bannon** (no contact details)
- Astrid (no contact details)
- Annas (no contact details)

Context: "3BIS want to go to the island Feb. 2-5... we have not purchase them tickets. They are hoping they can fly to NY and then fly with you to the island."

**7. February 2019 -- Epstein Brokers Barak-Bannon Meeting ([EFTA02633609](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02633609.pdf))**
Epstein tried to arrange a meeting between Ehud Barak (former Israeli PM) and Bannon: "steve bannon here tomorrow morning if you want to join. 930?" Barak replied: "Good idea. Done." Epstein followed up: "steve canceled, sick in wash. you can still come or do later. or come anytime today tomorrow and if you like we can get him on the phone."

**8. SDNY Evidence Discovery -- Trump-Maxwell Photo on Bannon's Phone ([EFTA00025553](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00025553.pdf), [EFTA00030999](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00030999.pdf))**
During WBTW case review, an AUSA found a photo on Bannon's seized iPhone 7: "I'm helping out with the responsiveness review for WBTW and I've been looking through Steve Bannon's iPhone 7 on Cellebrite. As I was going through the images from that phone, I found an image of Trump and Ghislaine Maxwell on Bannon's phone." Supervisor responded: "Thanks very much for flagging -- no need to do anything with this one, but thanks for letting me know."

**9. Bannon-Epstein Texts Not Responsive to Warrant ([EFTA00027290](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00027290.pdf))**
AUSA notification: "Wanted to let you know that there are a number of text messages between Steve Bannon and Jeffrey Epstein on Bannon's iPhone 7. They aren't responsive to our warrant." -- This means the texts existed but were outside the scope of the WBTW search warrant.

**10. SDNY Scheduling Overlap ([EFTA00019286](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00019286.pdf), [EFTA00024471](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00024471.pdf))**
AUSA trial calendar showing: "5/24: U.S. v. Steve Bannon et al (3-4 weeks probably) / 6/21: U.S. v. Noel (MCC Epstein guards) (1 week)" -- same prosecutor handling both cases.

## PART 5: ANALYSIS -- WHY THE IGE/WoW GOLD THEORY FINDS NO SUPPORT

### The Theory
Steve Bannon ran IGE (Internet Gaming Entertainment), a Hong Kong-based company that sold in-game virtual gold (primarily World of Warcraft gold) for real cash, approximately 2005-2007. The question is whether Epstein could have used this mechanism to launder money.

### What the Evidence Shows
1. **Zero mentions** of World of Warcraft, Warcraft, IGE (as a company), Internet Gaming Entertainment, Blizzard, Affinity Media, MMORPG, gold farming, virtual gold, virtual currency (in gaming context), in-game currency, game gold, real money trading, or any related term across 3.5 million records.

2. **The Bannon-Epstein relationship documented in these files is from 2017-2019** -- a decade after Bannon left IGE/Affinity Media. By the time Bannon and Epstein were communicating, Bannon had long since moved on to Breitbart News (2012+) and the Trump campaign/White House (2016-2017).

3. **The nature of their relationship was political access brokering**, not financial. Epstein was connecting Bannon to foreign leaders (MBS, Ehud Barak), sending him luxury gifts (Apple Watch), sharing political news articles, and inviting him to the island alongside diplomats and business figures.

4. **No financial transactions** between Bannon and Epstein are documented. No wire transfers, no payments, no invoices, no business arrangements. The SDNY prosecutors who reviewed Bannon's seized iPhone 7 found the Bannon-Epstein texts "not responsive to our warrant" (the WBTW fraud warrant), suggesting no financial fraud connection.

5. **No alternative virtual currency schemes** are documented either. Searches for e-gold, Liberty Reserve, WebMoney, Perfect Money, Second Life/Linden dollars, and other pre-Bitcoin virtual currency systems all returned zero results.

6. **Epstein's documented cryptocurrency interest** (LedgerX, Bitcoin, blockchain) is entirely separate from gaming currencies and involved legitimate (if opaque) financial technology investments, not money laundering through game economies.

### Conclusion
The Epstein DOJ files contain **absolutely no evidence** linking Epstein to World of Warcraft gold, IGE, or any virtual game currency laundering scheme. The Bannon-Epstein relationship was real but was about political influence and social networking in the 2017-2019 period, with no connection to Bannon's earlier gaming industry ventures. This theory, while creative, finds zero support in the documentary record.

### DS9/DS11 Full-Corpus Confirmation (2026-02-12)
A full-corpus revisit across DS9 (531,284 pages) and DS11 (331,655 pages) confirmed the negative finding. The only new result: [EFTA00752613](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00752613.pdf) (DS9) contains Brock Pierce's biography explicitly listing him as "major stakeholder in Internet Gaming Entertainment, chairman and president of Revenue Apex." This document is Pierce's bio forwarded in connection with his Epstein relationship (September 2011). Related emails: [EFTA00428081](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00428081.pdf) (Pierce to Groff: "Re: Jeffrey Epstein") and [EFTA00720224](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00720224.pdf) (Groff to Epstein forwarding Pierce's bio). The Pierce-IGE connection exists textually, but relates to Pierce's broader Epstein relationship (extensively documented in other reports -- 20+ emails 2014-2017, $15M Blockchain Capital IV investment via Caterpillar Trust), not to any WoW gold money laundering scheme.

DS9 also contains copies of Bannon-Epstein emails already documented from DS11: [EFTA01030719](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA01030719.pdf) (Epstein forwarding David Schoen "Privileged and Confidential" email, March 2019) and [EFTA00850125](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00850125.pdf) (Bannon to Epstein "Re: peres" -- "always the trains," March 2018). These confirm the political access brokering relationship. No financial/gaming content.

All other DS9/DS11 searches returned zero or false positive results: "IGE" = OCR noise ("intelligence," "diligence"), "World of Warcraft" = 0, "Affinity Media" = 0, "gold farming" = 1 hit (tax policy article about virtual world taxation, [EFTA01131043](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA01131043.pdf), unrelated to Epstein).

**Classification: MINOR -- CONFIRMING NEGATIVE.** The original report's exhaustive 120+ query negative finding stands with full-corpus confirmation across all 12 datasets.

## APPENDIX: SEARCH METHODOLOGY

### Databases Queried
- the primary document text database -- 1,808,942 redaction records (hidden text under redactions)
- the Dataset 10 document text database -- 1,629,776 redaction records (alternate extraction)
- the OCR text extraction database -- 38,955 OCR records (text extracted from images)
- the image catalog database -- 29,152 image analysis records (analyzed image content)

### Total Unique Search Queries Executed
Over 120 individual systematic searches across all document collections, covering:
- Direct game/gaming terms (World of Warcraft, Warcraft, WoW, Blizzard, MMORPG, online game)
- IGE and related entities (IGE, Internet Gaming Entertainment, Affinity Media)
- Virtual currency terms (gold farming, virtual gold, virtual currency, in-game, game gold, game currency, e-gold, Liberty Reserve, WebMoney, Perfect Money, Linden, Second Life, real money trading)
- Bannon cross-referenced with: gaming, gold, IGE, Hong Kong, China, virtual, payment, wire, transfer, laundering, Bitcoin, crypto
- Bannon-associated entities (Breitbart, Cambridge Analytica, We Build the Wall, WBTW)
- Hong Kong + gold combination
- All Bannon mentions (for comprehensive review)

### False Positive Analysis
Every apparent hit was manually reviewed. All "WoW" hits were the exclamation "wow." All "IGE" hits were substrings of words like "intelligence," "Doniger," "diligence," "Niger." All "Blizzard" hits were metaphorical usage. All "Hong Kong" + "gold" hits were Bloomberg terminal data containing "Goldman Sachs" near "Hong Kong" office listings.
