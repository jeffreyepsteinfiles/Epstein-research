# EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

This analysis identifies two key redacted references from the DOJ Epstein files:

1. **JABWCPA@gmail.com** = **CORRECTION (Revisit):** DS11 email headers unambiguously identify JABWCPA@gmail.com as the personal/professional email address of **Jeanne Anne Brennan Wiebracht**, Epstein's USVI-based administrative assistant and CPA. The "JABW" stands for her initials: **J**eanne **A**nne **B**rennan **W**iebracht. The "CPA" suffix reflects her accounting role within the organization. The original report's attribution to Richard Kahn was incorrect -- both Jeanne Brennan and Richard Kahn received all DB financial reports on the same distribution lists, which caused the misidentification. See revised Finding below.

2. **Institution-1** (from the bail memo [EFTA00028785](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00028785.pdf)) = **Deutsche Bank**, the financial institution holding Epstein's accounts from August 2013 through 2019, which the Government subpoenaed in connection with the SDNY prosecution.

3. The **$10,000,000/year overseas** reference describes earnings flowing through Institution-1's records to accounts outside the United States, consistent with Epstein's USVI residency and international financial footprint.

This pattern repeats across dozens of documents ([EFTA01467935](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01467935.pdf), [EFTA01467988](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01467988.pdf), [EFTA01468027](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01468027.pdf), [EFTA01468241](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01468241.pdf), [EFTA01468306](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01468306.pdf), [EFTA01468319](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01468319.pdf), [EFTA01468367](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01468367.pdf), [EFTA01468476](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01468476.pdf), [EFTA01468519](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01468519.pdf), [EFTA01468531](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01468531.pdf), [EFTA01468577](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01468577.pdf), [EFTA01468599](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01468599.pdf), [EFTA01468678](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01468678.pdf), [EFTA01468687](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01468687.pdf), [EFTA01469128](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01469128.pdf), [EFTA01469599](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01469599.pdf), [EFTA01469638](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01469638.pdf), [EFTA01469684](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01469684.pdf), [EFTA01469762](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01469762.pdf), [EFTA01469904](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01469904.pdf), [EFTA01470358](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01470358.pdf), [EFTA01470365](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01470365.pdf), [EFTA01470374](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01470374.pdf), [EFTA01470512](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01470512.pdf), [EFTA01470562](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01470562.pdf), [EFTA01470739](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01470739.pdf), [EFTA01470747](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01470747.pdf), [EFTA01470928](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01470928.pdf), [EFTA01470955](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01470955.pdf), [EFTA01470988](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01470988.pdf), and many more).

**Analysis:** JABWCPA@gmail.com was a second email address -- likely an accounting-specific professional email -- used to route DB financial reports to the same person or firm as richardkahn12@gmail.com. The consistent co-occurrence on identical distribution lists confirms they serve the same client/representative function.

## A.6 — The OCR Variants

The database contains OCR misreadings of JABWCPA that further confirm it is a single email:
- `JABWCPA@GMAIL.COM` (correct reading, 6+ instances)
- `1ABINCPA@GMAIL.COM` (OCR confusion of J->1, W->IN, [EFTA01455851](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01455851.pdf))
- `1A8WCPA@GMAILCOM` (OCR confusion, J->1, B->8)
- `Jabwcpa Gmail (Erna M...` -- The "Erna" fragment appears to be OCR bleed from nearby text (Erna Menniti, a DB employee on the same email chains)

## A.7 — Other Accountant References

- **"Joe Angileri - accountant"** ([EFTA01379932](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01379932.pdf)) -- Mentioned separately as an accountant, possibly a forensic accountant or other CPA in Epstein's circle
- **"SHRCPASLLC"** ([EFTA01432373](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01432373.pdf)) -- Another CPA entity name found in the files; possibly "SHR CPAs LLC"
- **"Forensic Accountant"** -- Multiple references to government forensic accountants investigating Epstein

## A.8 — JABWCPA Conclusion

**CORRECTION (Revisit -- DS11 Evidence):** The original finding attributing JABWCPA to Richard Kahn is **incorrect**. DS11 contains multiple emails sent directly FROM Jeanne Brennan Wiebracht using jabwcpa@gmail.com as her email address:

- [EFTA02349173](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02349173.pdf) (DS11): "On Monday, 29 February 2016, Jeanne <jabwcpa@gmail.com> wrote: yes" (forwarded chain about "Anna's Salary")
- [EFTA02353230](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02353230.pdf) (DS11): "On Tue, Nov 5, 2014 at 1:05 PM, Jeanne Brennan Wiebracht <jabwcpa@gmail.com> wrote:"
- [EFTA02361912](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02361912.pdf) (DS11): "From: Jeanne Brennan [mailto:jabwcpa@gmail.com]" corresponding with Toshiba International about solar energy on Little St. James Island
- [EFTA02369673](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02369673.pdf) (DS11): "From: Jeanne Brennan [mailto:jabwcpa@gmail.com] To: 'Jeffrey Epstein' Subject: RE: Anna's Salary"
- [EFTA02384062](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02384062.pdf), [EFTA02386987](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02386987.pdf), [EFTA02450341](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02450341.pdf) (DS11): Additional emails confirming the same attribution

**REVISED FINDING: JABWCPA@gmail.com is the personal/professional email address of Jeanne Anne Brennan Wiebracht**, Epstein's administrative assistant based in the USVI. "JABW" = her initials (Jeanne Anne Brennan Wiebracht). "CPA" reflects her financial/accounting role. The original report's observation that JABWCPA appears on Deutsche Bank distribution lists alongside richardkahn12@gmail.com remains correct -- both Jeanne Brennan and Richard Kahn received all DB financial reports. But the email belongs to Jeanne, not Kahn.

**Revised Confidence: 99%** (up from 95%, and corrected in attribution)

# TASK B: INSTITUTION-1 IDENTIFICATION

## B.1 -- The Bail Memo ([EFTA00028785](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00028785.pdf))

The Government's bail memorandum contains three references to "Institution-1," all found in text extracted from document layers:

### Reference 1 (Page 3):
> "[Epstein] is extravagantly wealthy and worth, according to records relating to the defendant recently obtained by the Government from a financial institution ('Institution-1'), more than $500 million."

### Reference 2 (Page 4):
> "[He already earns at least] tens of millions of dollars per year outside of the United Sta[tes] [--] $10,000,000 per year, according to records from Institution-1, [living in the U.S. Virgin] Islands traveling extensively abroad and residing in part in Pari[nce; there would be little to...]"

### Reference 3 (Page 10):
> "conviction and the non-prosecution agreement ('NPA'). Records obtained by the Government from Institution-1 appear to show that just two days later, on or about November 30, 2018, the defendant wired $100,000 from a trust account he controlled to an individual named as a possible co-conspirator in the NPA. The same records appear to show that just three days after that, on or about December 3, 2018, the defendant wired $250,000 from the same trust account to another [co-conspirator]"

## B.2 -- Timeline Analysis: Why Institution-1 Is Deutsche Bank

**The critical temporal marker is November-December 2018.** The bail memo states the Government obtained records from Institution-1 showing wire transfers on November 30, 2018 and December 3, 2018.

**Key facts:**
- **JP Morgan** closed Epstein's accounts in **2013** (confirmed by Bates-stamped documents "JPM-SDNY-xxxxx" with dates through 2012-2013 and "Opportunities Group MTM Summary (2012 Closed Positions) March 2013")
- **Deutsche Bank** opened the Epstein/Southern Financial relationship on **8/26/2013** (confirmed: "8/26/2013 SOUTHERN FINANCIAL RELATIONSHIP")
- **Deutsche Bank** maintained Epstein accounts through **2019** when they were finally exited

The November-December 2018 wire transfers could **ONLY** have been recorded by Deutsche Bank, since JP Morgan had terminated Epstein's accounts 5+ years earlier.

## B.3 -- The $500 Million Question

The bail memo states Institution-1's records show Epstein was "worth more than $500 million."

**Deutsche Bank account balances found in the files:**
- The Haze Trust: $49,460,098.13 (06/21/2018), $40,583,100.79 (08/17/2018), $49,233,909.70 (earlier)
- Southern Financial LLC: up to $7,013,127.50
- Southern Trust Company: up to $4,096,966.10
- Multiple other accounts (HBRK, JEGE, Plan D, NES, Butterfly Trust, etc.)

Total DB balances visible in the "Large Balances" reports peak at roughly **$50-60 million across all accounts**. This is far short of $500 million.

**Resolution:** Deutsche Bank, as a wealth management institution, would have maintained comprehensive client financial profiles including:
- Self-reported net worth statements (required for KYC/AML)
- Financial statements submitted to open accounts
- Property valuations (Epstein's NYC mansion alone was appraised at $13,000,000 per one document; the 71st Street property was far more valuable)
- Investment portfolio statements from other institutions
- Total relationship documentation including third-party assets

The "$500 million" figure reflects Epstein's **total net worth as represented to Deutsche Bank** (or discovered by government investigators in DB records), not just the cash balances at DB. This is consistent with Epstein's known assets: the NYC mansion (~$77M), the NM ranch, the USVI islands, the Paris apartment, aircraft, plus investment portfolios.

One document fragment states: "It's a total of $30.7 million for Epstein that was worth..." ([EFTA01648786](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01648786.pdf)) -- suggesting investigators were tallying account values.

## B.4 -- The JPM-SDNY Production Confirms Separate Proceedings

The database contains documents with Bates stamps "JPM-SDNY-xxxxx" and headers reading "Confidential Treatment Requested by JPMorgan Chase." These are production documents from **the separate civil litigation** (the USVI v. JPMorgan Chase case, settled for ~$75M in 2023, and the Giuffre v. JPMorgan case, settled for ~$290M).

These JPM-produced documents cover the **pre-2013 era** and include:
- JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. account statements (P.O. Box 6076)
- The Private Bank at J.P. Morgan branding
- Primary Account records
- Statements dated through 4/30/11 and 3/31/11

The fact that JPM documents carry separate Bates numbers and were produced under different confidentiality designations confirms they come from a **different litigation track** than the Deutsche Bank documents central to the SDNY criminal case.

## B.5 -- The November 2018 Wire Transfers: Obstruction Evidence

The bail memo reveals critical obstruction evidence from Institution-1 (Deutsche Bank) records:

**Context:** On November 28, 2018, the Miami Herald published Julie Brown's investigative series about the 2008 non-prosecution agreement. The Government alleges:

- **November 30, 2018** (2 days after the Herald story): Epstein wired **$100,000** from a trust account to a possible co-conspirator named in the NPA
- **December 3, 2018** (3 days after that): Epstein wired **$250,000** from the same trust account to another co-conspirator

These wires, totaling $350,000 to potential co-conspirators within days of adverse media coverage, constituted evidence of potential witness tampering/obstruction. The trust account was at Deutsche Bank.

## B.6 -- Jes Staley Connection

The files reveal Jes Staley (then CEO of Barclays, formerly head of JP Morgan's Private Bank) was in direct email contact with Epstein's personal email (geevacation@gmail.com). The FBI "Prominent Names" documents confirm:

> "Jes Staley: [victim] stated [she was] told her to give Staley a massage at Epstein['s]. Staley forced her to put her hands on his [crotch] and had 'rough sex' with her."

Staley was the JP Morgan Private Bank executive who maintained Epstein's relationship at JPM. When JPM finally exited Epstein in 2013, the accounts moved to Deutsche Bank.

## B.7 -- Institution-1 Conclusion

**FINDING: Institution-1 in the bail memo ([EFTA00028785](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00028785.pdf)) is Deutsche Bank.**

Evidence:
1. The wire transfers cited (Nov 30 and Dec 3, 2018) occurred during the Deutsche Bank relationship period (2013-2019), years after JPM closed Epstein's accounts
2. Deutsche Bank was the primary financial institution under government subpoena in the SDNY case
3. The account structures described (trust accounts, wire capabilities, comprehensive financial records) match the Deutsche Bank "Southern Financial Relationship" architecture
4. The Government's description of "recently obtained" records is consistent with the 2019 SDNY investigation timeline targeting Deutsche Bank
5. All DB internal documents in the database (RM CODE 82289, balance reports, banker correspondence) confirm Deutsche Bank maintained the full suite of Epstein accounts through 2018-2019

# TASK C: THE $10 MILLION/YEAR OVERSEAS

## C.1 -- Full Reconstructed Context

From [EFTA00028785](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00028785.pdf), pages 3-4, the Government argued (combining hidden text with visible text):

> "[Epstein] is extravagantly wealthy and worth, according to records relating to the defendant recently obtained by the Government from a financial institution ('Institution-1'), more than $500 million."

> "[He already earns at least] tens of millions of dollars per year outside of the United Sta[tes --] $10,000,000 per year, according to records from Institution-1, [living in the U.S. Virgin] Islands traveling extensively abroad and residing in part in Pari[s, France; there would be little to ...]"

## C.2 -- "Outside of the United States" Analysis

The reference to "$10,000,000 per year" earnings "outside of the United States" has two plausible interpretations:

### Interpretation 1: USVI Income
Epstein resided in the **U.S. Virgin Islands** (St. Thomas), which for certain purposes is treated as a separate tax jurisdiction. DB documents confirm:
- USVI address: "St. Thomas, USVI 00802"
- Entity: "Zorro Management LLC, K Quarter, B3, USVI 00802"
- LSJE, LLC had accounts at **FirstBank Puerto Rico** (another non-mainland institution)
- Filing information references "VIRGIN ISLANDS"

The USVI economic development program provided significant tax benefits to residents, which is why Epstein relocated there. Income earned through USVI entities could be characterized as "outside the United States" in a federal bail context.

### Interpretation 2: International Income
The DB files also reveal international financial activity:
- **Prime Overseas Investments** -- A Deutsche Bank entity/fund referenced in multiple emails ([EFTA01372473](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01372473.pdf), [EFTA01372474](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01372474.pdf), [EFTA01372486](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01372486.pdf), [EFTA01372490](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01372490.pdf)) with dates in September-November 2018, managed with Chryssoula Giannakaki
- **International wire transfers** -- "USD internationalwire" ([EFTA01367442](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01367442.pdf)), "E international wire" ([EFTA01363523](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01363523.pdf))
- **Paris residence** -- The bail memo explicitly mentions "residing in part in Paris"
- **Euro purchases** -- Multiple DB emails regarding "Euro purchase JE acc xxx 9691"
- **Rothschild accounts** -- Kahn cc'd on "Subject: RE: Rothschild [C]" with DB bankers
- **Fx Rates** -- Appears on every JABWCPA distribution list, indicating foreign currency exposure

### Interpretation 3 (Most Likely): Combined
The $10M/year figure likely represents Epstein's income from **all non-mainland-US sources** as reflected in Deutsche Bank records, including:
- Investment returns from offshore/international portfolios
- Income from USVI-based entities (Southern Financial, Southern Trust, Zorro Management, LSJE)
- Returns from international investments (Prime Overseas Investments)
- Rental/property income from the Paris apartment

## C.3 -- The Offshore Architecture

The database reveals a layered offshore structure:
- **Second Level** references with "(Offshore)" notations
- **"GEMENT, LLC / K QUARTER, B3 / USVI 00802"** (Zorro Management USVI address)
- **Onsite/Offshore** dual designations in account documentation
- **FirstBank Puerto Rico** as a banking intermediary for LSJE, LLC
- **"Overseas"** notations in account review documents

## C.4 -- $10M/Year Finding

**FINDING:** The $10,000,000/year figure cited in the bail memo represents the minimum annual income recorded in Deutsche Bank's records as flowing to or through Epstein's accounts from sources outside the continental United States. This includes USVI-domiciled entity income, international investment returns, and offshore financial activity. The Deutsche Bank "Southern Financial Relationship" architecture facilitated this activity through multiple subsidiary accounts with FX exposure and international wire capability.

# SYNTHESIS: THE FINANCIAL CONTROL STRUCTURE

## The Epstein-Kahn-DB Triangle

The forensic evidence reveals a tight financial control structure:

1. **Richard D. Kahn / HBRK Associates** served as the central accounting node:
   - Sole authorized signer on HBRK Associates account at DB
   - Cc'd on virtually all financial transactions
   - Received all DB financial reports (via both richardkahn12@gmail.com AND jabwcpa@gmail.com)
   - Handled tax documentation (FACTA, Gift Tax, Tax Returns)
   - Managed wire transfers, escrow accounts, trust distributions
   - Coordinated with Darren Indyke (Epstein's lawyer) on all major transactions

2. **Deutsche Bank** (Institution-1) provided the banking platform:
   - Opened the "Southern Financial Relationship" on 8/26/2013 (immediately after JPM exit)
   - Stewart Oldfield and Paul Morris served as primary relationship managers (Note: Paul Barrett was Epstein's personal portfolio manager at JPMorgan and later Alpha Group Capital, not a DB relationship manager)
   - HNW ClientServices handled report distribution
   - Account balance reports sent to JABWCPA, richardkahn12, Pinedo, Smith, Cothron, Morris, Stepanian, Amanda Kirby
   - Peak combined balances exceeded $50M across all Epstein entities

3. **The Inner Circle receiving financial reports:**
   - JABWCPA@gmail.com (Jeanne Brennan Wiebracht -- USVI administrative assistant/CPA; **CORRECTED** from original Kahn attribution)
   - richardkahn12@gmail.com (Kahn -- personal)
   - Amanda Kirby (Epstein's assistant/office)
   - Darren Indyke (DKIESQ -- Epstein's attorney)
   - Lesley Groff (Epstein's executive assistant)
   - Jeanne Brennan (Epstein's staff)
   - Various DB bankers (Pinedo, Smith, Cothron, Morris, Oldfield, Barrett, Stepanian)

## ADDENDUM: DS9/DS11 REVISIT FINDINGS (2026-02-12)

### The Rosetta Stone: [EFTA00081426](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00081426.pdf) (DS9)

An internal AUSA email dated July 12, 2019 (same date as the Government's bail/detention memo) provides definitive confirmation of Institution-1 = Deutsche Bank. The email, titled "notes on [Deutsche Bank subpoena returns]," states:

> "DB00001 - at 11: Estimated annual income: $10,000,000 / Estimated net worth: $500MM+ / [Accountant -- Harry Beller, HBRK Associates, Accountant"
> "DB000117 - made payments to: 12/3/18, $250,000 / 4/22/15, $50,000 / 1/28/15, $50,000 / 9/24/15, $23,625"

The "DB00001" and "DB000117" are Deutsche Bank document production numbers. The $10M income, $500MM+ net worth, and $250K on 12/3/18 are identical to the bail memo's Institution-1 figures. This document also identifies Harry Beller (not Richard Kahn) as the accountant listed in DB's records.

### Amanda Kirby FBI Interview ([EFTA00128765](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00128765.pdf), DS9)

Complete 15-page FBI FD-302 interview of Amanda Kirby, Deutsche Bank associate, conducted August 10, 2021. Key clarifications:
- Harry Beller "was also one of EPSTEIN'S accountants. Wire requests would generally come in from KAHN, who was EPSTEIN'S accountant. KAHN would at least be CC'd on all requests."
- "Bella Klein -- Was an assistant to Richard Kahn."
- Kirby "did not recall if she ever flagged any EPSTEIN wires as suspicious."
- Callback verification stamps required for wires above $50,000.

This clarifies the hierarchy: Richard Kahn was the senior accountant; Harry Beller was a second accountant at HBRK; Bella Klein was Kahn's assistant.

### FirstBank Puerto Rico Subpoena Response ([EFTA00065864](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00065864.pdf), DS9)

Grand Jury Subpoena response (FB Num. SUB-19353, March 9, 2020) reveals the complete USVI banking architecture. Harry Beller was an authorized signer on accounts dating back to 1998 (Little St James LLC, alongside Ghislaine Maxwell). Jeanne Brennan-Wiebracht (JABWCPA) was authorized signer on multiple entity accounts including IGO Company LLC, Thomas World Air LLC, and Southern Trust Company Inc.

### Charles Schwab SAR: $27.6M Suspicious Activity ([EFTA00151544](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00151544.pdf)-151545, DS9)

Charles Schwab filed a SAR covering $27,658,324 in suspicious activity between 6/28/2019 and 7/10/2019 (immediately before Epstein's arrest). The SAR concerned "attempted wires for the purpose of real estate, in light of negative media surrounding Jeffrey Epstein" and referenced HBRK Associates. The FBI was considering whether HBRK and Schwab accounts were "facilitating" Epstein's operations.

### Honeycomb Asset Management: $70M Liquid ([EFTA00068100](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00068100.pdf), DS9)

Attorneys Reed Brodsky and Stephanie Brooker reached out on behalf of Honeycomb, which was "currently holding funds for entities linked to Epstein and Richard Khan": approximately $70M liquid for the benefit of Southern Trust, plus $1M for Kahn and his spouse. The Butterfly Trust held illiquid assets (an entity awaiting IPO).

### Complete Co-Conspirator Payment Timeline ([EFTA00092643](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00092643.pdf), DS9)

Government Exhibit providing the complete timeline of payments to potential co-conspirators (>$10,000) with full account numbers: MC2 Model Management received $79,440 (Dec 2013-Jan 2014); redacted recipients received $50K+$50K+$23,625 (2015) from Butterfly Trust/JE accounts; Aviloop LLC received $45K (Nov 27, 2018) from JEGE LLC and $100K (Nov 30, 2018) from Butterfly Trust; a redacted recipient received $250K (Dec 3, 2018) from Butterfly Trust; and two redacted recipients received $175K+$110K (Dec 19, 2018) from Southern Financial. These match [EFTA00081426](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00081426.pdf)'s AUSA notes exactly.

### Bloomberg FOIA for Institution-1 ([EFTA00040515](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00040515.pdf), DS9)

Bloomberg News submitted a FOIA request specifically seeking to identify Institution-1, referencing Document 11, Case 1:19-cr-00490-RMB. SDNY's response noted: "This is very likely covered by exemption."

### FBI CHS Reporting on Boris Nikolic ([EFTA00128842](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00128842.pdf)-843, DS9)

The FBI ran a Confidential Human Source to report on Boris Nikolic's activities as part of the Southern Trust wire fraud investigation (Case ID #: 272-SJ-3262541). Nikolic (Managing Director of bng0 and Biomatics Capital) was named as a potential successor trustee in Epstein's trust.
