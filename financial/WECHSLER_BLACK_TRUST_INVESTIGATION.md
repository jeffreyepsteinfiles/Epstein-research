## THE CRITICAL EMAIL -- [EFTA02664953](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02664953.pdf)

On December 21, 2016, at 4:11 PM, Jeffrey Epstein sent the following email from his personal Gmail account (jeevacation@gmail.com) to Leon Black:

> "lets liquidate the J BLACK trust. the reason is that judy has passed. .2 deal with wechsler telling at least joe, and probably others that there are 'sensitive accounts' why he would do that is beyond me. .3. we should mock up this years gift tax to verify. all in order."

This email is significant for three independent reasons:

1. **Epstein is directing the liquidation of a trust named for the Black family** -- demonstrating operational control over Black's financial structures
2. **"Wechsler" -- identified as Brad Wechsler, Managing Partner of Elysium Management (Black's Family Office) -- is revealing the existence of "sensitive accounts" to others**, and Epstein is alarmed about it
3. **Epstein is directing the preparation of gift tax returns** -- further evidence of his hands-on role in Black's tax affairs

The email also references **"Judy"** who "has passed" -- identified as **Judy Ellen Black**, Leon Black's mother, who died November 15, 2015. The reference is about 13 months after her death. **[CORRECTION -- see Revisit Integration below]:** The full-corpus revisit located the complete J. Black Trust Agreement ([EFTA00292681](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00292681.pdf), DS9), dated April 29, 2014 -- 19 months BEFORE Judy Black's death. The trust was created by Leon Black at Epstein's direction, with Darren Indyke drafting it, and was NOT a Judy Black vehicle. Judy's death was the stated occasion for liquidation, but the trust predated her passing.

## 1. WHO IS WECHSLER?

### Identity: Bradley J. Wechsler

**Brad Wechsler** is the **Managing Partner of Elysium Management LLC**, the single-family office that manages the personal wealth, trusts, and estate planning of Leon Black, co-founder of Apollo Global Management.

#### Key Facts:
- **Since January 2015**: Managing Partner of Elysium LLC / Elysium Management LLC
- **Prior career**: Co-Chairman and Co-Chief Executive Officer of IMAX Corporation (May 1996 through April 2009)
- **Office address**: 445 Park Avenue, Suite 1401, New York, NY 10022 (same as Elysium Management)
- **Role**: Oversees Black's diversified portfolio spanning private equity, real estate, and public markets

#### Database Evidence:

| EFTA Number | Content | Significance |
|---|---|---|
| [EFTA02490368](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02490368.pdf) | Email from Epstein to Brad Wechsler (Sept 6, 2015) about tax returns: "i will try to have someone bring the tax returns to europ. they did not arrive until after i had left." | Shows Epstein directing Wechsler on tax matters |
| [EFTA02060918](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA02060918.pdf) | Reference to "Brad Wechsler's office" | Administrative scheduling reference |
| [EFTA01737903](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01737903.pdf) | "Brad Wechsler" -- contact list entry | Epstein's contacts |
| [EFTA02082033](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA02082033.pdf) | "Brad Wechsler" with scheduling times | Meeting coordination |
| [EFTA02083062](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA02083062.pdf) | "Brad Wechsler" and "Yvonne Berger" | Contact list with Elysium staff |
| [EFTA02664953](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02664953.pdf) | The critical Dec 21, 2016 email: Epstein alarmed that Wechsler is telling people about "sensitive accounts" | Shows Wechsler had knowledge of undisclosed financial arrangements |

#### Critical Significance:

Wechsler was **the head of Black's family office** -- the very person responsible for managing all of Black's financial affairs. When Epstein complains that Wechsler is "telling at least joe, and probably others that there are 'sensitive accounts,'" this reveals:

1. **Wechsler knew about financial arrangements that Epstein wanted kept secret**
2. **Epstein considered certain Black-related accounts to be so sensitive they should not be discussed even within the family office**
3. **Wechsler was apparently breaching Epstein's imposed information barrier by discussing these accounts with "Joe" and others**
4. **The existence of a deliberate compartmentalization scheme** -- where even the Managing Partner of the family office was expected to hide certain accounts from colleagues

The reference to **"Joe"** likely refers to a tax professional or accountant within or connected to the Elysium operation. In [EFTA02366598](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02366598.pdf), a "Joe V" is mentioned in a September 2017 email about tax return formatting, described as someone who works with tax returns and has opinions about filing methods. This person was likely a tax preparer or CPA who should not have known about the "sensitive accounts."

## 2. THE J BLACK TRUST -- COMPLETE STRUCTURE AND HISTORY

### What Was the "J BLACK Trust"?

The complete trust agreement and creation chain are in DS9:

#### A. Complete Trust Agreement Found -- [EFTA00292681](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00292681.pdf) / [EFTA00292702](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00292702.pdf) (DS9)

- **Dated:** April 29, 2014 -- 19 months BEFORE Judy Black's death (November 2015)
- **Grantor:** Leon David Black
- **Trustees:** Leon David Black and Melanie Spinella (Leon's assistant at Apollo)
- **Initial Funding:** $2,000,000
- **Type:** Discretionary gift trust -- Trustees have "complete and uncontrolled discretion" to distribute to Leon Black's family members or any person to whom Leon Black previously made gifts
- **Trust may be referred to as:** "THE J. BLACK TRUST"
- 20+ pages including trust terms, signature pages, notarization

**Creation Email Chain:** [EFTA00370268](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00370268.pdf) (DS9) -- Darren Indyke to Lesley Groff: "Please see JE's email below confirming the request that you send Melanie at Leon's office the attached Trust Agreement." Confirms Epstein directed the trust's creation and Indyke drafted it. [EFTA00370275](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00370275.pdf) / [EFTA00370276](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00370276.pdf): Groff to Spinella: "At Jeffrey's request, I have attached an execution copy of The J. Black Trust." Spinella: "Will do." The trust was executed through Epstein's staff, not Black's lawyers.

**Operational Details:** [EFTA00370270](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00370270.pdf) -- "Turrin removed as a successor Trustee" and "$2,000,000 is transferred to the trust." Thomas Turrin (CPA at Raich Ende Malter & Co. LLP) was originally named as successor trustee but removed.

**Earlier Drafts:** [EFTA00587101](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00587101.pdf) / [EFTA00587809](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00587809.pdf) / [EFTA00589300](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00589300.pdf) / [EFTA00589321](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00589321.pdf) -- January-February 2014 drafts showing evolution of trust terms before the April 29, 2014 final execution.

**Post-Arrest Inquiry:** [EFTA01020924](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA01020924.pdf) / [EFTA01020958](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA01020958.pdf) (DS9, October 2018) -- Epstein to Thomas Turrin: "did you review the j black trust bank account?" and "was a final return filed for j black? was its own taxpayer. was there money still there in jan? 17." Confirms Epstein was monitoring trust status through early 2017, suggesting potential wind-down.

**Separate Judy Black Provision:** [EFTA00609831](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00609831.pdf) / [EFTA00616927](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00616927.pdf) (DS9) contain Leon Black's Revocable Trust, which includes "$5 million in a separate trust for Judy's benefit" if she survives him. This is SEPARATE from the J. Black Trust, further confirming the J. Black Trust was not a Judy Black vehicle.

**Assessment:** The J. Black Trust was a discretionary gift trust created by Leon Black at Epstein's direction. It was NOT connected to Judy Black. Epstein's team (Indyke, Groff) created and executed the trust, naming Black's personal assistant Melanie Spinella as co-trustee. This structure gave Epstein effective operational control over a trust that could distribute money to anyone Black had previously made gifts to -- an extraordinarily broad discretionary power.

#### ~~A. Connection to Judy Black~~ [SUPERSEDED]

~~Judy Ellen Black, Leon Black's mother, died November 15, 2015. Epstein's email says "the reason is that judy has passed" as the basis for liquidating the trust.~~ The original speculation of a Judy Black connection is incorrect. The trust was created April 29, 2014 (19 months before her death) and bears Leon's middle initial "J" (Leon J. Black), not Judy's initial. Judy's death was cited as a reason to liquidate, suggesting she may have been a beneficiary or the trust served a purpose that was no longer needed after her passing.

#### B. The "J. Black Trust" as an Active Payment Vehicle

Critical evidence from **[EFTA02731526](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2012/EFTA02731526.pdf)** reveals the J. Black Trust was actively making payments to an unidentified woman:

> From: Jeanne M. Christensen (Partner, Wigdor LLP)
> Date: Thursday, May 27, 2021, 4:19 PM
> Subject: documents
>
> "I am attaching the following documents:
> * Sample of bank statements showing deposits from the only 3 accounts that transferred money to her: **'Leon J. Black'; 'J. Black Trust' and the 'E Trust'** (which paid from November 2015 until the last deposit in 2021)
> * Sample of texts and emails, incl. with Leon's longtime trusted admin assistant **Melanie Spinella**; people at **Goldman Sachs** that Leon arranged to interview [her] -- never for a 'real job.'
> * Text from Leon Black right [redacted]
> * Lists of various names and numbers associated with Black from a notebook
> * Text from [redacted] in October 2019 asking Black for a copy of the **NDA**
> * Letter from lawyer she retained to get a copy of the NDA"

#### C. Bank Statement Corroboration ([EFTA02731529](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2012/EFTA02731529.pdf))

Bank statements show:
- **"Incoming Wire Transfer: WIRE FROM THE J BLACK TRUST"** -- November 2015 period
- **"Incoming Wire Transfer: E TRUST"** -- same period

These wire transfers confirm the J. Black Trust was an operational entity making regular payments.

#### D. The "E Trust" Connection -- IDENTIFIED AS "GIGI (E) TRUST"

[EFTA00812184](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00812184.pdf) (DS9, p.33) contains an Epstein email to Spinella: "paper gigi (E) trust to avoid gift tax." The "E Trust" is the **"Gigi (E) Trust"** -- a gift tax avoidance vehicle for one of Black's daughters (likely Victoria or Olivia, "Gigi" being a family nickname). This is a Black family instrument, NOT an Epstein entity. [EFTA00812184](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00812184.pdf) p.5 confirms both trusts were discussed in a single context as Black family matters: "we should discuss e trust and j black trust. brad buying phaidon. artspace folding?"

~~The "E" could stand for Epstein or Estate~~ -- this speculation is now superseded. Both the J. Black Trust and E Trust were Black family instruments under Epstein's operational direction.

The two-source payment structure where both trusts funded payments to an NDA-protected woman remains significant, but the payments originated from Black family entities, not from a combination of Black and Epstein entities.

### Prosecutorial Significance of the J BLACK Trust

The J. Black Trust was apparently:
1. **Making regular payments to a woman** who had an **NDA** with Leon Black
2. **Operating alongside an "E Trust"** (potentially Epstein-linked) making parallel payments
3. **Subject to Epstein's operational control** -- he could order its liquidation
4. **Connected to "sensitive accounts"** that Wechsler was not supposed to discuss

---

## 3. THE "LIQUIDATE" INSTRUCTION -- FULL EMAIL CONTEXT

### Parsing the Email Line by Line

**"lets liquidate the J BLACK trust"**
- Epstein is directing the dissolution/liquidation of a trust entity
- He is telling Black what to do, not asking permission -- demonstrating his directive role
- "Lets" implies urgency and mutual action

**"the reason is that judy has passed"**
- Judy Black died November 15, 2015 -- 13 months before this email
- The delay suggests the trust's connection to Judy created a legal or tax complication that Epstein wanted to resolve
- Liquidation after a beneficiary's death could be about: distributing assets, avoiding probate complications, eliminating audit trails, or restructuring to avoid estate tax consequences

**".2 deal with wechsler telling at least joe, and probably others that there are 'sensitive accounts'"**
- This is a numbered action item -- item 2 on Epstein's list
- Brad Wechsler, the Managing Partner of Black's own family office, was revealing the existence of secret accounts
- "At least joe" -- means the information has leaked to at least one person, possibly more
- Epstein's alarm suggests these accounts were supposed to be hidden even from senior family office staff

**"why he would do that is beyond me"**
- Epstein genuinely cannot understand why the Managing Partner of a family office would discuss the family's financial accounts with other family office staff
- This reveals the degree of compartmentalization Epstein imposed -- not even the head of the family office was supposed to know about or discuss all accounts

**".3. we should mock up this years gift tax to verify. all in order"**
- Item 3: Prepare gift tax returns
- "Mock up" -- suggests creating draft returns to verify amounts
- "All in order" -- implies checking that gift tax reporting aligns with the trust structures

---

## 4. "SENSITIVE ACCOUNTS" -- WHAT AND WHY SENSITIVE

### What Accounts Were Sensitive?

Based on the full documentary record, the "sensitive accounts" likely included some or all of the following:

#### A. Accounts Making Payments to NDA-Protected Women
- The J. Black Trust and E Trust were making regular payments to at least one woman
- That woman had an NDA with Leon Black
- Bank statements show payments "ranging from 15K to 167K" per deposit
- Payments continued from November 2015 through 2021
- These were, by definition, "sensitive" -- they documented payments connected to personal conduct that Black wanted hidden

#### B. Accounts Connected to the Epstein Payment Conduit
- Leon Black paid Epstein $158-170 million between 2013-2017
- These payments flowed through multiple entities: Southern Trust Company, Black Family Partners LP, Narrow Holdings LLC, BV70 LLC
- The amounts dwarfed what any legitimate advisor would receive
- Any accounts reflecting these flows were "sensitive" because they could reveal the true nature and scale of the relationship

#### C. Accounts Connected to the Art/Tax Avoidance Scheme
- The Haze Trust held art assets and received auction proceeds
- Like-kind exchanges were used to defer capital gains taxes
- The Giacometti/Cezanne transaction involved $25-30 million
- These structures could constitute tax fraud if not properly reported

#### D. The Remainder Trust and GRAT Structures
- The 2006 GRATs held ~$585 million in Apollo partnership interests
- These were designed to keep assets out of Black's taxable estate
- Epstein's "proprietary solution" to the estate tax problem potentially saved $1 billion+
- The IRS has never audited these structures (confirmed by Black to the Senate Finance Committee)
- Excess income distributions violated trust terms

### Why Were They Sensitive?

The accounts were "sensitive" because disclosure could reveal:
1. **Payments to women under NDAs** -- reputational and potentially legal exposure
2. **The true scale of payments to a convicted sex offender** -- $158-170 million to Epstein
3. **Potentially fraudulent tax structures** -- schemes to avoid $1 billion+ in estate/gift taxes
4. **Epstein's operational control** over Black's family office -- creating questions about the nature of the relationship
5. **The flow of Black's money into Epstein's criminal enterprise** -- as acknowledged in Black's USVI settlement: "Jeffrey Epstein used the money Black paid him to partially fund his operations in the Virgin Islands"

---

## 5. TIMELINE: DECEMBER 2016 ALARM TO SUBSEQUENT FINANCIAL MOVEMENTS

### Detailed Chronological Reconstruction

**November 15, 2015**: Judy Ellen Black dies

**November 2015**: Payments from "J. Black Trust" and "E Trust" begin flowing to an unidentified woman (per Wigdor LLP attorney letter in [EFTA02731526](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2012/EFTA02731526.pdf))

**November 13, 2015**: $23,000,000 wire to Kellerhals Ferguson Kroblin PLLC (Epstein's USVI law firm) from Epstein's NOW/SuperNow account ([EFTA00027019](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00027019.pdf) Exhibit C)

**January 8, 2016**: $20,000,000 transferred to The Haze Trust (DB Brokerage Account) -- initial capitalization of the Haze Trust ([EFTA00027019](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00027019.pdf) Exhibit C)

**2016 -- No payments from Black to Epstein**: The Dechert report confirms "Black did not pay Epstein in 2016" -- the relationship was deteriorating over the fee dispute

**December 21, 2016**: THE CRITICAL EMAIL ([EFTA02664953](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02664953.pdf)) -- Epstein instructs Black to:
1. Liquidate the J BLACK trust
2. Deal with Wechsler's disclosure of "sensitive accounts"
3. Mock up gift tax returns

**March 10, 2017**: The Haze Trust Brokerage transfers **$36,000,000** to Haze Trust Checking, then **$35,999,000** to Haze Trust DBAGNY ([EFTA00027019](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00027019.pdf) Exhibit D)

**March 27, 2017**: Haze Trust DBAGNY transfers **$15,000,000** to **Plan D, LLC** Checking -- Epstein's entity that managed his Gulfstream jet ([EFTA00027019](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00027019.pdf) Exhibit D)

**March 31, 2017**: **BV70 LLC** (Black's entity) transfers **$22,500,000** to **Plan D, LLC** (Epstein's entity) -- described as a "loan" for an "art transaction" ([EFTA00027019](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00027019.pdf) Exhibit A; Dechert Report)

**April 17, 2017**: **BV70 LLC** transfers another **$8,000,000** to **Plan D, LLC** ([EFTA00027019](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00027019.pdf) Exhibit A)
- Combined BV70-to-Plan D transfers: **$30,500,000**

**April 25, 2017**: Leon and Debra Black c/o Apollo Management transfer **$8,000,000** to Southern Trust Company, Inc. -- Black's final payment to Epstein ([EFTA00027019](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00027019.pdf) Exhibit A)

**June 19, 2017**: **Christie's Inc.** pays **$7,725,000** to The Haze Trust Checking -- auction proceeds ([EFTA00027019](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00027019.pdf) Exhibit D)

**September 25, 2017**: **Sotheby's** pays **$11,536,544** to The Haze Trust Checking -- auction proceeds

**October 24, 2017**: **Sotheby's** pays **$11,249,417** to The Haze Trust Checking -- auction proceeds

**Total auction proceeds flowing into Haze Trust in 2017**: ~$30,510,961

### The $30.5M Pattern

The connection between the $30.5 million in BV70-to-Plan D "loans" (March-April 2017) and the ~$30.5 million in auction proceeds flowing to Haze Trust (June-October 2017) suggests a **circular funding mechanism**:

1. Black's entity (BV70) loans $30.5M to Epstein's entity (Plan D) in spring 2017
2. Art is consigned from the Haze Trust to Christie's and Sotheby's
3. Auction proceeds ($30.5M) flow back to the Haze Trust in mid-late 2017
4. Haze Trust distributes funds to various Epstein entities (Southern Financial LLC, Southern Trust Company)
5. Only $10M of the $30.5M "loan" was ever repaid (October 2018)

This structure allowed Epstein to:
- Receive $30.5M in ostensible "loans" from Black
- Convert art assets to cash through auction houses
- Route the proceeds through multiple entities
- Keep $20.5M without repayment

### Key Intermediaries and Professionals

| Person | Role | Key Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| **Brad Wechsler** | Managing Partner, Elysium Management | Revealed "sensitive accounts" to colleagues; received Epstein directives on tax returns. Epstein privately considered him guilty of "total and utter incompetence" ([EFTA00465675](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00465675.pdf), DS9) but Black kept him in role. 25+ DS9 calendar entries show regular meetings with Epstein at Apollo offices and 71st St. Dec 2016 email was a routine reporting function, not a disclosure event. |
| **Ada Clapp** | Elysium Staff | Worked on trust closing timing, Phaidon loan, Dartmouth pledges. Epstein directed her firing: "ada goes, hire heather a paralegal" ([EFTA00812184](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00812184.pdf), DS9) |
| **Melanie Spinella** | Executive Assistant to Leon D. Black, Apollo Management; Co-Trustee of J. Black Trust | Referenced in Wigdor LLP letter; communicated with NDA woman. Received Apple Watch from Epstein. $1M Melanoma Research Alliance contribution routed through her at Apollo ([EFTA00298998](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00298998.pdf)). Primary conduit for Epstein's instructions to Black's office. |
| **Richard Joslin** | CFO, Elysium Management / Leon Black's Family Office | Personally interviewed by Epstein for CFO position in Aug 2013 ([EFTA00284739](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00284739.pdf)).

## 7. PROSECUTORIAL SIGNIFICANCE

### A. Epstein's Operational Control Over Black's Financial Affairs

The December 21, 2016 email is the most damning single piece of evidence regarding the nature of the Epstein-Black relationship because it shows:

1. **Epstein directing trust liquidation** -- not merely advising, but ordering: "lets liquidate the J BLACK trust"
2. **Epstein managing Black's tax compliance** -- "we should mock up this years gift tax to verify"
3. **Epstein enforcing information compartmentalization** -- demanding that the head of Black's own family office be disciplined for revealing "sensitive accounts"
4. **Epstein treating Black as a subordinate** -- the email reads as directives from a superior, not suggestions from an advisor

This contradicts the Dechert Report's characterization that Epstein merely "provided advice" and that Black made all decisions independently.

The 97-page email compilation [EFTA00812184](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00812184.pdf) (DS9) proves Epstein was not merely an "advisor" but the de facto chief operating officer of Black's family office, with authority to: hire and fire staff ("ada goes, hire heather a paralegal. Joslin goes or is closely managed by new cfo... castrucci goes asap"), manage tax filings ("sign your gift tax return today if possible"), question art dealers ("gagosian. no written contract??!! fishy to me - who transfers 100 million dollars overseas without a contract" regarding Larry Gagosian), and negotiate his own $50-60M compensation. He personally interviewed candidates for Black's CFO position ([EFTA00284739](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00284739.pdf), Aug 2013 calendar: "5:15pm Interview Richard Joslin"). [EFTA00465675](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00465675.pdf) contains his fee negotiation letter: "$150 million free" in tax savings, "50-60 million the fair price" for his services, and a devastating critique of Wechsler's "total and utter incompetence."

### B. The "Sensitive Accounts" as Evidence of Concealment

Epstein's alarm that Wechsler was discussing "sensitive accounts" constitutes potential evidence of:

1. **Conspiracy to conceal financial transactions** -- if accounts were deliberately hidden from the family office's Managing Partner, this suggests those accounts contained transactions that could not withstand scrutiny
2. **Tax fraud** -- accounts that must be hidden from tax professionals may contain unreported income or improper deductions
3. **Structuring** -- compartmentalizing financial information to prevent any single person from seeing the complete picture is a classic money laundering technique
4. **Obstruction** -- creating information barriers within a family office to prevent discovery of illicit payments

### C. The $30.5M Circular Flow

The near-exact matching of BV70-to-Plan D "loans" ($30.5M) and auction proceeds flowing to Haze Trust (~$30.5M) in 2017 raises questions about:

1. **Was the "loan" actually a payment disguised as a loan?** -- Only $10M was repaid; the remaining $20.5M was never recovered
2. **Were the art auctions used to launder the loan proceeds?** -- Art sales through Christie's and Sotheby's provided a veneer of legitimate commerce
3. **Did the Haze Trust serve as a laundering vehicle?** -- Money flowed: Black -> BV70 -> Plan D -> Haze Trust -> Southern Financial -> various accounts
4. **Tax evasion** -- If these were payments rather than loans, they should have been reported as income to Epstein and possibly as gifts from Black

### D. The NDA Woman and the J. Black Trust

The revelation ([EFTA02731526](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2012/EFTA02731526.pdf)) that an attorney from Wigdor LLP presented evidence to prosecutors showing:
- Regular payments from "Leon J. Black," "J. Black Trust," and "E Trust" to a woman
- Payments ranging from $15K to $167K per deposit
- The woman had an NDA with Leon Black
- The woman was given fake job interviews at Goldman Sachs
- Nearly 700 pages of bank statements documenting these transfers

This raises questions about:
1. Whether the J. Black Trust was used to make payments connected to sexual misconduct
2. Whether Epstein helped structure these payments
3. Whether the "E Trust" was an Epstein entity making parallel payments -- potentially to maintain leverage over Black
4. Whether the December 2016 liquidation order was motivated by fear of discovery

### E. The USVI Settlement as Consciousness of Guilt

Leon Black settled with the U.S. Virgin Islands Attorney General for $62 million and received immunity from criminal prosecution in the USVI. The settlement explicitly acknowledges that **"Jeffrey Epstein used the money Black paid him to partially fund his operations in the Virgin Islands."**

This acknowledgment, combined with the December 2016 email showing Epstein's alarm about "sensitive accounts" being discussed, creates a powerful narrative:
- Black knew his payments were funding Epstein
- Epstein maintained control through knowledge of Black's "sensitive accounts"
- When the family office managing partner began discussing these accounts, Epstein immediately moved to liquidate the trust and contain the disclosure

### F. IRS Non-Enforcement

The Senate Finance Committee investigation revealed that the IRS has never audited:
- The 2006 GRATs that held ~$585M in Apollo interests
- The remainder trust
- The mutual release of claims scheme
- The $158-170M in payments to Epstein
- The art transaction structures

This non-enforcement, combined with Epstein's directive to "mock up this years gift tax to verify," suggests that Epstein was actively managing Black's tax exposure while knowing the structures would not withstand IRS scrutiny.

### G. Key Questions Remaining

1. **Was the J. Black Trust liquidated as Epstein ordered?** If so, what happened to its assets?
2. **Did Brad Wechsler cooperate with investigators?** As the person who knew about "sensitive accounts," his testimony would be critical
3. **Who is "Joe"?** This person received information about sensitive accounts and may be a key witness
4. **~~What was the E Trust?~~** [RESOLVED] The E Trust is the "Gigi (E) Trust," a gift tax avoidance vehicle for Black's daughter -- a Black family instrument, not an Epstein entity.
5. **What happened to the $20.5M in unreturned "loans"?** Did Epstein use this money to fund criminal operations?
6. **What are the complete "sensitive accounts"?** How many accounts existed that were hidden from the family office staff?

## DB ZWIRN / FORTRESS DISPUTE -- NEW DS9 DISCOVERY

[EFTA00587244](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00587244.pdf) (DS9) contains a Susman Godfrey LLP letter (April 22, 2010) to Brad Karp (Paul, Weiss) and Lara Flint (Senior Litigation Analyst, Paul, Weiss) regarding the "Epstein/DB Zwirn Investment Dispute." Epstein demanded $140,000,000 plus $35,000,000 in prejudgment interest from DB Zwirn Special Opportunities Fund / Fortress Value Recovery Fund I LLC. Claims included breach of fiduciary duty, breach of contract, conversion, fraud, and breach of partnership agreement. A Glenn Dubin affidavit was enclosed, providing sworn testimony supporting Epstein's claims. Paul, Weiss represented DB Zwirn/Fortress as defendants.

Tolling agreement documents ([EFTA00584968](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00584968.pdf), [EFTA00587247](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00587247.pdf)) confirm this was an active legal dispute, not just a threat.

This reveals Karp simultaneously socialized with Epstein while his firm represented parties adverse to Epstein in a $175M dispute -- and the Dubin affidavit is significant given Eva Dubin's implication in trafficking.

## "SENSITIVE ACCOUNTS" EMAIL -- DUAL PRODUCTION CONFIRMED

[EFTA01058973](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA01058973.pdf) (DS9) is the same "sensitive accounts" email that appeared as [EFTA02664953](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02664953.pdf) in DS11. The critical December 21, 2016 email now exists in TWO separate DOJ productions. Dual production suggests the email was pulled from two different custodians or collection streams.

## REVISIT INTEGRATION (2026-02-12)

**Classification: SIGNIFICANT NEW FINDINGS**

Full-corpus revisit against DS9 (531,284 pages) and DS11 (331,655 pages) integrated above. Key corrections:

1. **J. Black Trust Identity (CRITICAL):** Complete trust agreement found ([EFTA00292681](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00292681.pdf)) -- created April 29, 2014 (19 months before Judy Black's death). Grantor: Leon Black. Co-Trustees: Leon Black + Melanie Spinella. $2M initial funding. NOT connected to Judy Black.
2. **E Trust Identity (CRITICAL):** Identified as "Gigi (E) Trust" -- gift tax avoidance vehicle for Black's daughter. NOT an Epstein entity. Black family instrument under Epstein direction.
3. **Wechsler Role Corrected:** Routine manager, not whistleblower. Epstein called him "total and utter incompetence" but Black retained him for discretion over competence.
4. **Epstein's Scope of Control Expanded:** 97-page email compilation ([EFTA00812184](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00812184.pdf)) proves de facto COO authority: hiring/firing staff, managing tax filings, questioning $100M art deals, negotiating $50-60M personal compensation.
5. **DB Zwirn $175M Dispute (NEW):** Epstein claimed $175M from DB Zwirn/Fortress with Brad Karp (Paul, Weiss) as opposing counsel and Glenn Dubin affidavit supporting Epstein -- creating serious conflict questions about Karp's dual social/adversarial relationship.
6. **Sensitive Accounts Dual Production:** Dec 2016 email exists in both DS9 ([EFTA01058973](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA01058973.pdf)) and DS11 ([EFTA02664953](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02664953.pdf)).
7. **New Personnel Identified:** Thomas Turrin (CPA/former successor trustee), John Castrucci (COO, fired by Epstein), Alan Halperin (Paul Weiss), Eileen Alexanderson (former family office head), Heather Gray (Elysium staff).
