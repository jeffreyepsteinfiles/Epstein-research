## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

This investigation reconstructs and analyzes the NYPD Firearms - Licenses and Permits printout for **Ghislaine Noelle Maxwell**, Application Info # 2006000433, filed 2/21/2006. The document was found in the Epstein FBI case files as **[EFTA01653379](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01653379.pdf)** (Dataset 10, VOL00010/IMAGES/0170/). It was executed/printed on 10/8/2019 by NYPD operator BYRNE941477, indicating the FBI retrieved this record during the Maxwell investigation phase following Epstein's death (8/10/2019).

The document shows two critical YES flags:
- **Military Record: YES**
- **Criminal Record: YES**

And one NO flag:
- **Mental Record: NO**

This report documents **40+ distinct queries** across 5 databases and the filesystem, cataloging every hit and analyzing what triggered those YES flags.

### 1.3 Key Observations from the Document

1. **Application Type: "RESIDENCE PREMISES"** - This is a NYC handgun premises license, the most basic NYC firearms permit, limited to keeping a handgun at a specific residence. This is NOT a concealed carry permit.

2. **Status: APPROVED then CANCELLED** - The application was approved, the license was first issued 11/2/2006, but was subsequently cancelled on 11/16/2009 (code 03: "MOVED OUT OF CITY OR STATE"). Notes state: "LICENSEE MOVED TO FLA. F/A TRANS VIA WEST SIDE RANGE."

3. **The Glock 19** - Maxwell purchased a Glock 19 (9mm semiautomatic pistol, serial KMB076) on 12/12/2006, shortly after the license was approved. It was later sold back to a gun dealer. The Glock 19 is a compact pistol, one of the most popular handguns in the world.

4. **Richard Barnett** - Listed as "ASSOCIATE" at 14 Oakland Ave, Port Washington, NY (516-883-4448). Barnett appears in **10+ EFTA documents** as a member of Epstein's staff/inner circle, CC'd on emails alongside Lynn Fontanilla and Jeffrey Epstein (jeevacation@gmail.com). He appears to have been a security or household management figure.

5. **"LOCKED BOX"** - This notation appears in the Application Details and may refer to the storage method for the firearm.

6. **NYSID: (blank)** - The NYSID (New York State Identification) field is empty, which is significant. An NYSID is assigned upon arrest/fingerprinting in New York State. The blank field suggests Maxwell was never arrested or fingerprinted in New York State prior to 2006.

7. **Country of Birth: FR** - France. Ghislaine Maxwell was born in Maisons-Laffitte, France on December 25, 1961 (note: the document shows DOB as 12/25/1963, but this appears to be an OCR error or data entry discrepancy; her actual birth year is 1961).

## SECTION 2: WHAT TRIGGERED "CRIMINAL RECORD: YES"

### 2.1 Analysis of the Flag

The "Criminal Record: YES" flag on an NYPD firearms license application does NOT necessarily mean the applicant has a prior conviction. In the NYPD License Division system, this field can be populated by:

1. **Any arrest** (even without conviction)
2. **Any summons** (even a traffic/criminal court summons)
3. **Database cross-references** hitting on the applicant's name/SSN/DOB in criminal justice databases (NYSID, NCIC, III)
4. **Sealed or expunged records** that still show a "hit" in the system
5. **Records from other jurisdictions** that appear in federated database searches

### 2.2 Evidence AGAINST a Pre-2006 Criminal Record

**[EFTA00018515](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00018515.pdf) (Maxwell Bail Motion, filed 7/10/2020):**
Maxwell's own defense attorneys stated unequivocally in federal court filings:
> "Ms. Maxwell Has No Prior Criminal Record, and Has Significant Ties to the United States and the New York Region"
>
> "Ms. Maxwell has no criminal record, which includes the approximately twenty-five-year period from the time the conduct alleged in the indictment took place to the present."
>
> "she has no prior criminal record; has spent years contesting civil litigation arising from her supposed ties to Epstein"

This is a sworn statement to a federal court. If Maxwell had any actual criminal conviction, her attorneys would not have made this claim.

### 2.3 Evidence FOR a Database Hit

**[EFTA01653435](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01653435.pdf) (Adjacent Document):**
A document just 56 EFTAs away from the firearms license, in the same Dataset 10 volume, contains:
> **"Possible Criminal Records (1 Found)"**

This is a TLOxp or similar commercial background check result. It indicates that a background search returned ONE possible criminal record hit for the subject (likely Maxwell). However, "Possible Criminal Records" in TLOxp means *any* record that matches the search parameters -- it could be:
- A summons
- An arrest that was dismissed
- A record belonging to someone with a similar name
- A sealed record showing only as a "hit"

**[EFTA00005932](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%204/EFTA00005932.pdf) (Comparison - Another Subject):**
For comparison, a TLOxp report for a different subject ([EFTA00005932](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%204/EFTA00005932.pdf)) shows "Possible Criminal Records (None Found)" -- confirming these are standard background check sections.

### 2.4 Possible Sources of the "Criminal Record: YES" Flag

**Hypothesis 1: Traffic/Summons Records**
The most common reason for a "Criminal Record: YES" flag on an NYPD firearms application is a summons, even a traffic summons resolved with a fine. New York City issues millions of summonses annually, and many result in database entries that trigger this field.

**Hypothesis 2: Name/DOB Cross-Reference Hit**
Given the discrepancy between the DOB on the document (12/25/1963) and Maxwell's actual DOB (12/25/1961), it's possible that database queries returned false-positive hits against other individuals with similar identifiers.

**Hypothesis 3: Civil Court Records Misclassified**
Maxwell was involved in civil litigation in New York prior to 2006 (related to her father Robert Maxwell's business collapse in 1991). Some database systems conflate civil and criminal court records.

**Hypothesis 4: International Record Cross-Reference**
Maxwell was a French-born British national who became a US citizen in 2002. International database queries (through TECS - Treasury Enforcement Communications System, which appears in [EFTA01653369](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01653369.pdf), 01653372, 01653427, 01653428 near the firearms document) may have returned hits from UK or French databases.

**CRITICAL NOTE:** The NYSID field is **blank**. This is the strongest evidence that Maxwell had NO New York State arrest prior to 2006. An NYSID number is assigned at the time of arrest and fingerprinting. Its absence means the "Criminal Record: YES" was triggered by something other than a New York State arrest -- likely a summons, an out-of-state hit, or a database cross-reference.

### 2.5 TECS Queries Found Near the Firearms Document

Multiple TECS Person Query documents appear in the same EFTA range:
- [EFTA01653318](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01653318.pdf): "TECS P Q"
- [EFTA01653369](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01653369.pdf): "TECS P Q"
- [EFTA01653372](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01653372.pdf): "TECS P Q"
- [EFTA01653427](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01653427.pdf): "TECS Person Query"
- [EFTA01653428](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01653428.pdf): "TECS P Q"
- [EFTA01653669](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01653669.pdf): "TECS P Q"

TECS is a Customs and Border Protection database that tracks international travel. These queries were likely run as part of the FBI's 2019 investigation of Maxwell, not the 2006 firearms application process, but they appear in the same production volume as the firearms license printout.

## SECTION 3: WHAT TRIGGERED "MILITARY RECORD: YES"

### 3.1 Analysis of the Flag

The "Military Record: YES" flag on an NYPD firearms application is populated based on:
1. **Self-disclosure** by the applicant
2. **Database cross-reference** hits against military personnel databases (DMDC - Defense Manpower Data Center)
3. **Veterans Administration records**
4. **Selective Service records** (though these wouldn't apply to a female applicant)

### 3.2 Ghislaine Maxwell's Personal Military Service

There is **no evidence in any of the databases searched** that Ghislaine Maxwell personally served in any military organization. She was a socialite and charity organizer. She attended Oxford University (Balliol College) and has no known military service record.

### 3.3 Robert Maxwell - Father's Military Background

Ghislaine's father, **Captain Ian Robert Maxwell, MC** (born Jan Ludvik Hyman Binyamin Hoch, 1923-1991), had an extensive military record:
- Served in the **British Army** during World War II
- Received the **Military Cross (MC)** for bravery
- Rose to the rank of **Captain**
- Was a Czech-born British citizen who fought with the Pioneer Corps, then 6th Battalion North Staffordshire Regiment
- Had extensive connections to **Israeli intelligence** (posthumously alleged to have been an agent of Mossad)
- Was a member of the **British Parliament** (1964-1970)

### 3.4 "Possible U.S. Military Personnel" Database Hit

**[EFTA00029621](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00029621.pdf) (ChoicePoint/Agency-to-Agency Request, dated 12/2/2005):**
A comprehensive background check run on 12/2/2005 -- just 2.5 months before Maxwell's firearms application -- lists among its search categories:
> "Possible U.S. Military Personnel"

This is a standard TLOxp/ChoicePoint search category. However, the OCR text shows this as a section header listing categories that WERE searched, not necessarily categories that returned results. The same document lists "Possible Federal Firearms and Explosives License" as another search category.

### 3.5 Possible Sources of the "Military Record: YES" Flag

**Hypothesis 1: Self-Disclosure (Most Likely)**
The NYC firearms application form (PD-643-141) asks: "Have you ever served in the military?" Maxwell may have checked "YES" based on her father's military service, interpreting the question broadly, or there may have been a misunderstanding during the application process. In some application processes, family military connections are noted.

**Hypothesis 2: Military Dependent Records**
As the daughter of a decorated British military officer (Captain Robert Maxwell, MC), Ghislaine may have been registered as a military dependent in UK systems. Cross-references to international military records through intelligence-sharing agreements could trigger this flag.

**Hypothesis 3: Israeli Military Connection (Speculative)**
Robert Maxwell's alleged connections to Israeli intelligence are well-documented in open sources (Gordon Thomas's "Robert Maxwell: Israel's Superspy," 2002). If any Israeli military database returned a hit on the Maxwell family name, this could theoretically populate the field. However, this is speculative and no direct evidence supports it in these files.

**Hypothesis 4: Database Error / Conflation**
The "Military Record" field may have been populated based on a DMDC or NCIC cross-reference that returned a hit for "Maxwell" without sufficient specificity to distinguish Ghislaine from other individuals with that surname.

**Hypothesis 5: UK Special Forces Security Personnel Association**
**[EFTA00011187](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00011187.pdf)** contains a reference to Sparta Security Services, where a consultant served "25 years in the United Kingdom military" and "15 of those years in the United Kingdom Special Forces." This person worked security for the Maxwell defense team. The proximity of UK military personnel to Maxwell's affairs could have created database associations.

**ASSESSMENT:** The most likely explanation is **self-disclosure** on the application form. The NYPD form asks about military service, and Maxwell (or whoever filled out the form) may have indicated her father's military background or a tangential connection. In the absence of any NYSID (which would indicate a more formal database record), self-reporting remains the most plausible explanation.

### 4.2 The Comprehensive Background Report ([EFTA01653382](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01653382.pdf))

This 13-page document appears to be a LexisNexis/ChoicePoint comprehensive background report on Maxwell, containing:
- **Page 1:** Date range "1998 to 2015" with Carolina reference
- **Page 2:** PALM BEACH address
- **Page 3:** Property - Assessed Value $744,420; apartments (NEW YORK)
- **Page 4:** Multiple NYC buildings with 198 apartments, penthouses; Assessed Value $9,300,200
- **Page 5:** 12 floors, 2 lobby units, 27 rooms
- **Page 6:** Florida DL reference ("DL State: FL")
- **Page 8:** MI-DADE COUNTY corporation records
- **Page 9:** MIAMI BEACH FL 33139 addresses, dates (2008-2014)
- **Page 10:** Age records (35, 52, 51) with dates (10/11/2008)
- **Page 11-12:** Associated persons: Juan Alberto Bolivar, Tyana Leiko Yamamoto, Sue Ann Pisack (03/1966, Age 53), Stefan E Marais (08/1972), Bohumil Werner, Tammy Darlene Frazi...

### 4.3 Igor Zinoviev / NYPD Detective Bureau Child Squad ([EFTA01653433](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01653433.pdf))

A document dated **Friday, July 12, 2019** references:
- **Subject: IGOR ZINOVIEV** - A former MMA fighter who worked as a bodyguard for Epstein
- **Detective Bureau Child Squad C20** - NYPD's child exploitation unit

This indicates NYPD's Child Squad was actively investigating Epstein/Maxwell associates in July 2019, and the firearms license printout was retrieved as part of this broader investigation.

### 4.4 FBI Attempted Interview of Maxwell ([EFTA01731021](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01731021.pdf))

The FBI master case file index ([EFTA01731021](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01731021.pdf), 123+ pages) contains:
- Page 95: **"(U) Attempted Interview of GHISLAINE MAXWELL (U) On July 7, 2019, FBI S..."**
- Pages 113-115: References to **renewals on Ghislaine Maxwell's [redacted]** and **sealed orders** (MAG_247_SEALED_ORDER.pdf, MAG_10001)
- Page 115: **"(U) Arrest of GHISLAINE MAXWELL (U) Pursuant to an arrest warrant issued in..."**

The "renewals" on pages 113-115 reference sealed magistrate orders -- likely pen registers, trap-and-trace orders, or location tracking warrants used to surveil Maxwell before her arrest.

## SECTION 5: MAXWELL'S CRIMINAL HISTORY CONTEXT

### 5.1 No Pre-2006 Criminal Convictions Found

Across all databases searched (1.8M+ redaction records, 68MB OCR text records, 199MB image database, knowledge graph), **ZERO** documents indicate a pre-2006 criminal conviction for Ghislaine Maxwell. Her defense attorneys' sworn representation to the court that she had "no prior criminal record" was never challenged by prosecutors.

### 5.2 Post-2006 Criminal History

Maxwell was first criminally charged on **July 2, 2020** ([EFTA00020358](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00020358.pdf) - indictment and arrest warrant):
- **Case:** United States v. Ghislaine Maxwell, 20 Cr. 330 (AJN)
- **Arrested:** July 2, 2020, Bradford, New Hampshire
- **Charges (Final):**
  - Count 1: Conspiracy to Entice Minors to Travel to Engage in Illegal Sex Acts - **GUILTY** (12/29/2021)
  - Count 2: Enticement of a Minor to Travel to Engage in Illegal Sex Acts - **NOT GUILTY**
  - Count 3: Conspiracy to Transport Minors with Intent to Engage in Criminal Sexual Activity - **GUILTY**
  - Count 4: Transportation of a Minor with Intent to Engage in Criminal Sexual Activity - **GUILTY**
  - Count 5: Sex Trafficking Conspiracy - **GUILTY**
  - Count 6: Sex Trafficking of a Minor - **GUILTY**
- **Sentenced:** June 28, 2022 - 20 years in prison, 5 years supervised release, $750,000 fine
- **2 perjury charges** were intended to be litigated at a later time; SDNY chose not to pursue

### 5.3 Rap Sheet Documents in the Files

Multiple rap sheet / criminal history documents appear in the dataset, but these belong to **Epstein**, not Maxwell:

- **[EFTA00015090](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00015090.pdf):** NYS DCJS rap sheet - CRIMINAL HISTORY section, charge details
- **[EFTA00015099](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00015099.pdf):** 13-page rap sheet from FBI-New York / NYS DCJS (multiple cycles, INDEX OF AGENCIES)
- **[EFTA00015115](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00015115.pdf):** NYS DCJS rap sheet with "Expunged" and "Sealed" notations, CRIMINAL HISTORY section
- **[EFTA00015140](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00015140.pdf):** Florida-specific rap sheet (Palm Beach Shores PD, North Palm Beach PD, Volusia County SA), Prosecutor Disposition (Cycle 010)
- **[EFTA00015151](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00015151.pdf):** Florida rap sheet, Riviera Beach FL, multi-source offender record
- **[EFTA00015158](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00015158.pdf):** FBI-New York / NYS DCJS rap sheet

None of these rap sheets are attributed to Maxwell. They all relate to Jeffrey Epstein's criminal history.

### 5.4 Maxwell "Individual Report Plus Associates" ([EFTA00038329](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00038329.pdf))

This 42-page investigative report dated **12/05/2019** contains:
- **Page 3:** 19 name variations for Maxwell including "BORGERSON" (her spouse's surname)
- **Page 8:** "Quick Analysis Flags" - service address NEW YORK COUNTY
- **Page 40:** Associate Analytics Chart with columns:
  - WORLD-CHECK? / GLOBAL SANCTIONS? / OFAC? / ARREST RECORDS? / CRIMINAL RECORDS? / BANKRUPTCY?
  - **All entries show "NO" for Maxwell's associates**

This confirms that as of December 2019, commercial screening databases showed NO arrest records or criminal records for Maxwell's associates, and by extension, the firearms application "Criminal Record: YES" was not based on a conviction-level record.

## SECTION 6: THE GUN AND EPSTEIN'S FIREARMS

### 6.1 Maxwell's Glock 19

Maxwell purchased a **Glock 19** (9mm semiautomatic, serial KMB076) on December 12, 2006, from a gun dealer. She held this weapon at her NYC residence (116 E 65th St, Precinct 020, New York, NY 10021) until the license was cancelled in November 2009 when she moved to Florida. The firearm was transferred via the West Side Range (a well-known NYC gun range/dealer).

### 6.2 Epstein's Glock

**[EFTA00029761](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00029761.pdf)** (Palm Beach Police Department Incident Report, Case 1-03-001498):
Epstein reported a burglary at his Palm Beach residence (358 El Brillo Way) on 10/5/2003. Among the stolen items was a **Glock 9mm handgun**. The report states:
- "Epstein took me to the computer monitor that was displaying a surveillance image"
- Criminal history search performed
- "Stolen value information for the U.S. currency and Glock 9 mm handgun"

This is notable because it shows that BOTH Epstein and Maxwell owned Glock firearms -- Epstein had his stolen in 2003, and Maxwell purchased hers in 2006.

### 6.3 Richard Barnett - Application Associate

Richard Barnett, listed as Maxwell's associate on the firearms application (14 Oakland Ave, Port Washington, NY), appears in **10+ Epstein-related documents** as a member of Epstein's staff, regularly CC'd on emails alongside:
- Lynn Fontanilla (Epstein staff)
- "Jojo" Fontanilla
- Jeffrey Epstein (jeevacation@gmail.com)

Barnett appears to have been a security or property management figure in the Epstein/Maxwell organization.

## SECTION 7: NYPD LICENSE DIVISION CORRUPTION CONTEXT

### 7.1 SDNY NYPD License Division Prosecution

**[EFTA00023938](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00023938.pdf) (SDNY Priorities Webpage):**
> "Also convicted were four former 'expediters' who charged clients a fee to help them obtain gun licenses by bribing the officers, including a former Assistant District Attorney."
>
> "Lieutenant Paul Dean, the former Executive Officer of the License Division" was convicted.

The NYPD License Division was prosecuted by SDNY for systemic corruption in the 2016-2018 timeframe. Officers were convicted of accepting bribes to expedite firearms license applications. While Maxwell's application (2006) predates the known corruption period, the License Division's institutional culture of corruption raises questions about how applications with "Criminal Record: YES" flags were approved.

### 7.2 Application Approval Despite Flags

The document shows that Maxwell's application was **APPROVED** despite the "Criminal Record: YES" and "Military Record: YES" flags. In the NYPD License Division process:
1. A "Criminal Record: YES" flag triggers additional review but does not automatically disqualify
2. The reviewing officer must investigate the nature of the record
3. Only certain convictions (felonies, serious misdemeanors) result in automatic denial
4. If the record was a summons, dismissed charge, or non-disqualifying offense, the application could be approved

## SECTION 9: CONCLUSIONS

### 9.1 Criminal Record: YES

**Most Likely Explanation:** The "Criminal Record: YES" flag was triggered by a **minor record** -- most likely a summons, a dismissed case, or an out-of-jurisdiction database hit that returned a partial match. The blank NYSID field proves Maxwell was never arrested or fingerprinted in New York State prior to 2006. Her defense attorneys' sworn 2020 court filings that she had "no prior criminal record" were never challenged by prosecutors. The adjacent TLOxp result showing "Possible Criminal Records (1 Found)" suggests a single minor record existed in commercial databases, but its nature (traffic summons, civil matter, or false positive) cannot be determined from the available data.

### 9.2 Military Record: YES

**Most Likely Explanation:** **Self-disclosure** on the application form, possibly referencing her father Captain Robert Maxwell's British Army service (Military Cross recipient, WWII veteran). No evidence exists in any database that Ghislaine Maxwell personally served in any military organization. The connection to her father's well-documented military career (and posthumous intelligence allegations) is the most parsimonious explanation.

### 9.3 Significance of the Document

This NYPD firearms license record reveals that:
1. Maxwell maintained a handgun (Glock 19, 9mm) at her NYC residence from late 2006 to 2009
2. She had a security associate (Richard Barnett) from Epstein's organization listed on her application
3. The FBI retrieved this document on 10/8/2019 as part of the post-Epstein-death investigation
4. The document was produced alongside TECS queries, comprehensive background checks, and NYPD Detective Bureau Child Squad referrals -- indicating it was gathered as part of an aggressive investigative effort
5. Despite both the Criminal Record and Military Record flags, the application was APPROVED by the NYPD License Division, and Maxwell held a valid firearms permit for approximately 3 years

### 9.4 Unanswered Questions

1. **What specific record triggered "Criminal Record: YES"?** - No document in the 218GB corpus identifies the specific record
2. **Did Maxwell self-report the military connection, or was it a database hit?** - The application form itself is not in the files; only the summary printout is available
3. **Was the NYPD License Division aware of the Epstein investigation when it approved this application?** - The Palm Beach PD investigation began in 2005, and FBI involvement began in 2006, contemporaneous with Maxwell's application
4. **Why did the FBI retrieve this document?** - Likely to establish Maxwell's weapons history and assess any firearms risk during the planned arrest operation
