## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

**[CORRECTED 2026-02-12]:** The original central thesis of this report -- that the 99-day gap in Apple Mail PLIST email metadata (November 14, 2018 through February 21, 2019) represented a genuine communication blackout -- has been **disproved** by the full text corpus. DS9 contains continuous, prolific jeevacation@gmail.com email activity throughout the entire alleged blackout period, including daily emails with associates such as Larry Summers, Ehud Barak, Kathy Ruemmler, George Church, and others. The "blackout" was an artifact of DS11 PLIST extraction methodology, not actual communication silence. See the Full Corpus Revisit Integration section at the end of this report for complete documentation.

The following findings from the original investigation remain valid:

1. **EXTENSIVE government communications exist during this period** -- The DOJ/SDNY was furiously opening an investigation, coordinating with FBI, traveling to Florida, and building the case. These emails are NOT from Epstein's systems but from government actors.

2. **Epstein continued FLYING during the blackout** -- TECS/CBP flight records document at least 8 private jet flights on N212JE during the blackout period, including a flight on the very day the Herald published (Nov 28, 2018). Groff calendar entries in DS9 confirm even more extensive travel than TECS records alone indicated.

3. **Epstein was actively PAYING people** -- Continuous check-writing from a personal account throughout Nov-Feb, plus critical wire transfers ($100K to Aviloop LLC on 11/30/2018, $250K on 12/3/2018) from the Butterfly Trust.

4. **A victim had ONGOING INTERACTIONS with Epstein during Dec 2018-July 2019** -- Epstein was still luring victims to NYC, Paris, Florida, and the Virgin Islands during this period.

5. **Evidence of prior destruction patterns** -- Documents reveal Epstein directed removal of computers from Palm Beach residence before a police search, directed shredding of directories, and his lawyer told an associate not to talk to police.

6. **Encrypted communication tools were registered to Epstein personally** -- DS9 reveals Epstein had Signal, Confide, WhatsApp, and Telegram accounts all registered to the same phone number (212-533-3739), documented in sex offender registry filings ([EFTA00168380](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00168380.pdf)).

7. **The FBI NY office opened its investigation on December 6, 2018** -- just 8 days after the Herald published. However, Epstein continued operating openly with apparent impunity throughout this period, not "going dark" as the original report concluded.

### Flight Calendar Summary ([EFTA00005994](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%204/EFTA00005994.pdf))

The FBI compiled a complete flight calendar showing Epstein's movements:

- **November 2018:** Outbound TEB --> France; Outbound France --> TEB; Outbound KBCT --> TIST; Outbound TIST --> TEB
- **December 2018:** Outbound TIST --> PBI (only one recorded TECS flight; **however, DS9 calendar entries show extensive Dec 2018 activity**: Bedford trip Dec 2, PB Dec 5, LSJ Dec 10, PB Dec 14, NY Dec 17, PB Dec 21, continuous through Dec 31. Travel was not reduced.)
- **January 2019:** [Calendar shows dates but no specific flights marked -- appears blank or with minimal activity]
- **February 2019:** Outbound TIST --> PBI; Outbound TIST --> Dom Rep; Outbound Dom Rep --> PBI

### CRITICAL: January 6, 2019 Flight with Darren Indyke

**[EFTA00037618](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00037618.pdf)** documents that on January 6, 2019, Epstein's lawyer **Darren K. Indyke** flew with Epstein on N212JE from Boca Raton (KBCT) along with a female passenger, David Rodgers (pilot), and Lawrence Visoski (pilot). This is the only flight during the blackout period where Indyke is documented as a passenger, suggesting an in-person meeting of significant importance -- potentially related to the financial restructuring that culminated in the $31.5M "dissolution event."

### Moscow Ticket: November 28, 2018

**[EFTA02265040](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02265040.pdf)** -- On the same day the Miami Herald published "Perversion of Justice" (Nov 28, 2018), Lesley Groff (Epstein's assistant) purchased a round-trip ticket:
- Moscow (SVO) --> New York (JFK), arriving **Dec 2, 2018**
- New York (JFK) --> Moscow (SVO), departing **Dec 13, 2018**
- Airline: Aeroflot SU 100/101
- The email footer contains: "jeevacation@gmail.com" -- Epstein's personal email

This is a ticket for someone flying FROM RUSSIA to meet Epstein in New York, purchased the very day the Herald series broke. The person arrived Dec 2 and departed Dec 13 -- a critical 11-day window.

### FBI Travel to West Palm Beach: February 14, 2019

**[EFTA01684300](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01684300.pdf)** -- FBI Document Synopsis
- "(U) On 02/14/2019, [...] (U) To document travel to West Palm Beach"
- This is the FBI traveling to Florida as part of the active investigation

## PART 3: FINANCIAL ACTIVITY DURING THE BLACKOUT

### Wire Transfers from Butterfly Trust (Deutsche Bank)

**[EFTA00020685](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00020685.pdf)** -- SDNY request to Deutsche Bank for wire transfer details:

| Date | Amount | Recipient | Receiving Bank | Account/Routing |
|------|--------|-----------|---------------|----------------|
| **11/30/2018** | **$100,000** | **Aviloop LLC** | **TD Bank** | Routing: 011400071 |
| **12/03/2018** | **$250,000** | **[Redacted individual]** | **Bank of America** | Routing: 026009593 |
| 04/22/2015 | $50,000 | [Redacted] | JPMorgan | |
| 01/28/2015 | $50,000 | [Redacted] | JPMorgan | |
| 09/24/2015 | $23,625.44 | [Redacted] | JPMorgan | |

**CRITICAL:** The $100,000 wire to Aviloop LLC was sent on **November 30, 2018 -- exactly TWO DAYS** after the Miami Herald published "Perversion of Justice." Aviloop LLC is Nadia Marcinkova's company (Marcinkova was a key Epstein associate/victim who later became a pilot).

The $250,000 wire three days later on December 3 went to a redacted individual at Bank of America.

- The government's detention memo ([EFTA00039383](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00039383.pdf)) subsequently cited these post-Herald payments as evidence of witness tampering

## PART 4: EPSTEIN'S ONGOING CRIMINAL ACTIVITY DURING THE BLACKOUT

### Victim Interactions: December 2018 - July 2019

**[EFTA00011526](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00011526.pdf)** -- Attorney Proffer (March 1, 2021)
Call with AUSA, Attorneys Mariann Wang & Gloria Allred:

> "[Victim] had subsequent interactions with Epstein beyond November 2017, those interactions took place in **December 2018 - July 2019**"

Key details:
- "Accurate that JE lured [victim] to Paris & to Florida with offer of employment"
- "JE & another woman named [redacted] kept reaching out to [victim]. JE offered [victim] help"
- "[Victim] took up offer, and **JE bought a ticket for [victim] to travel to NY** and let [victim] stay in, so JE said, in essence, [victim] owed and [victim] felt obligated to agree to additional trips"
- "**Another trip to Florida & VI -- sexual abuse**"
- "[Victim] also went to JE's Paris apartment"
- "JE had [victim] arrange dentist appointments... **appointments were right around the time when JE was arrested**"
- "**JE would ask [victim] to find girls for him, and JE asked [victim] to meet with a young (18/19) girl for coffee in Russia.** [Victim] did so, but does not recall her name, just told JE that the girl seemed fine."

This is direct evidence that **Epstein continued his sex trafficking operation during the blackout period**, actively luring victims and recruiting in Russia.

### FBI Interview: December 4, 2018

**[EFTA00019024](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00019024.pdf)** -- FBI Electronic Communication, Case ID 31E-MM-NEW

### The Comprehensive Prosecution Memo ([EFTA02731082](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2012/EFTA02731082.pdf))

This privileged Attorney Work Product document reveals the full scope of Epstein's operation during and after the blackout:

**Evidence Destruction Pattern:**
- "Epstein and [redacted] directed [victim] to gather computers and directories from the Palm Beach house and give them to a man who would meet [her] there"
- "[Victim] followed these instructions and gave the computers and directories from Palm Beach to a man"
- "[Maxwell] then told [victim] to gather the directories from Epstein's Virgin Islands residence and bring them back to New York"
- "[Maxwell] reminded [victim] to check every building on Epstein's island for the directories"
- "[Victim] followed this instruction and brought the directories to Maxwell's house in New York, where she gave them to [Maxwell]"
- "**[Maxwell] then told [victim] to shred the directories in Maxwell's house**"
- "**Darren Indyke met with her and told her that if she ever needed help she should not talk to the police**"
- "Materials from the search warrant executed by the Palm Beach Police Department in 2005 confirm that **computers appeared to have been removed from Epstein's Palm Beach residence prior to the search**"

**Post-Herald Money:**
- "[Victim] believed Epstein sent her this money because he felt guilty for the trouble the articles caused her" [referring to the November 2018 Herald series]

**Epstein's Control During Work Release:**
- "When he was in jail, Epstein would have his **lawyer Darren Indyke and a paralegal bring him a computer**, which he used to have video sex with [victim]"
- "[Victim] put on his approved driver list and would drive him back to jail at night in a suburban with a mattress in the back. Most nights, **she and Epstein would park near the jail and have sex in the back of the car**"
- "Epstein seemed friendly with the guards at the jail"

### FBI Encryption Challenges

**[EFTA00016180](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00016180.pdf)** -- SDNY/FBI Email Chain about search warrant data (2020)
- FBI Senior Forensic Examiner discussing extraction of Epstein's devices
- "**Phones, tablets... gotten past encryption**"
- "cameras, DVRs, servers... When we review devices on such large cases, we..."
- "laptops, and desktop computers"
- Discussion of over 60 devices, extracting thousands of emails
- "file formats that are loadable onto Relativity"
- Reference to "Micro S[D]" and storage devices

**[EFTA00023962](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00023962.pdf)** -- Email about encrypted devices for Ghislaine Maxwell
- "it's our understanding that **hard drives materials for inmates needs to be non-encrypted** (and not have a password for access)"
- Requesting to "get these materials to her tomorrow if at all possible"

### Phone Changes

**[EFTA02060325](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA02060325.pdf)** -- Email:
- Subject: "Tess needs a new phone"

**[EFTA02167514](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA02167514.pdf), [EFTA02167550](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA02167550.pdf)** -- Emails:
- Subject: "New Phone Numbers Programmed?"
- These suggest coordination around phone changes, though dates are unclear

### The jeevacation@gmail.com Email

**[EFTA02265040](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02265040.pdf), [EFTA02439416](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02439416.pdf), [EFTA02439434](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02439434.pdf)** -- Multiple documents confirm Epstein used the email address **jeevacation@gmail.com** for personal communications. This was used for:
- Travel booking communications via Lesley Groff
- Direct communications with young women ("talk to nadia", "get 200$ from bella call the office")
- Communications about finding passports

The use of a Gmail account separate from any institutional email suggests Epstein maintained communications outside corporate/financial channels.

---

## PART 6: EVIDENCE DESTRUCTION AND POST-HERALD PAYMENTS

### Documented Pattern of Evidence Destruction

1. **Computer Removal Before Police Search (2005)**
   - Epstein directed a victim to gather computers and directories from Palm Beach
   - Computers were given to an unidentified man
   - "Materials from the search warrant executed by the Palm Beach Police Department in 2005 confirm that computers appeared to have been removed from Epstein's Palm Beach residence prior to the search" ([EFTA02731082](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2012/EFTA02731082.pdf))

2. **Directory Shredding**
   - Directories gathered from Virgin Islands and Palm Beach
   - Brought to Maxwell's NYC residence
   - "[Maxwell] then told [victim] to shred the directories in Maxwell's house" ([EFTA02731082](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2012/EFTA02731082.pdf))

3. **Lawyer-Directed Silence**
   - "Darren Indyke met with her and told her that if she ever needed help she should not talk to the police" ([EFTA02731082](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2012/EFTA02731082.pdf))

4. **Email Erasure Reference**
   - [EFTA02071136](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA02071136.pdf): "inadvertently erased the email you sent re NY trial"
   - [EFTA02071178](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA02071178.pdf): "inadvertently erased the email you sent re NY trial"

5. **Post-Herald Payments (Witness Management)**
   - $100,000 to Aviloop LLC (Nadia Marcinkova) on 11/30/2018 -- 2 days after Herald
   - $250,000 to redacted individual on 12/3/2018 -- 5 days after Herald
   - Victim stated Epstein "sent her this money because he felt guilty for the trouble the articles caused her"

6. **Multiple "destroy" references in email footers**
   - At least 30+ documents contain "destroy this communication and all copies thereof" language
   - While some are standard legal disclaimers, the volume and context within the Epstein network is notable

## PART 7: THE PROMINENT NAMES DOCUMENT

### FBI Internal Briefing on Prominent Individuals ([EFTA01660622](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01660622.pdf), pages 17-18)

This classified FBI document contains allegations against prominent individuals associated with Epstein. The document is part of the FBI's master case briefing and includes:

**Donald Trump:**
1. "[Victim] stated Epstein introduced her to Trump who subsequently forced her head down to his exposed penis which she subsequently bit. In response, Trump punched her in the head and kicked her out." (date range 1983-1985, victim would have been 13-15)
2. "[Victim] remember Epstein introduced her to Trump saying 'This is a good one, huh' and Trump responded 'Yes'." (date range roughly 1984, victim would have been 14)

**Harvey Weinstein:**
1. "[Victim] stated she gave Weinstein a massage, during which he fondled her, masturbated, and offered to pay her extra if he could ejaculate on her chest."
2. Multiple other victim accounts of Weinstein encounters at Epstein's direction

**Glen Dubin:**
- "[Victim] stated Maxwell instructed her to give Dubin a massage and do what she did for Epstein."

**Prince Andrew:**
- Multiple victim accounts including "[Victim] make Prince Andrew..." and "Steve Scully witnessed Andrew on Epstein's Island grinding a young girl"

**Jes Staley:**
- "[Victim] told her to give Staley a massage at Epstein's. Staley forced her to put her hands on his [penis] and had 'rough sex' with her."

**Leon Black:**
- Multiple accounts of sexual abuse during massages; threats made
- "Black threatened to [harm] her life and stated he had connections with [redacted]"

**Les Wexner:**
- References to "homosexual" activity and financial relationship

**Alan Dershowitz:**
- "[Victim] stated she gave Dershowitz a massage on Epstein's plane. (not a minor)"

**Bill Clinton:**
- "not a victim in the Epstein case"
- "[Victim] claimed she was invited to an orgy with Clinton but did not attend"

**Howard Lutnick:**
- "Simon Andriesz reported that Lutnick made his money through Ponzi schemes and money laundering. Lutnick and Epstein were neighbors and Epstein sold Lutnick a home for $10 which was then sold for millions."

**William Barr/Leon Black:**
- "NTOC filed by [victim], stated Barr and Black were present during abuses."
- "[Victim] stated she was at Epstein's for a model event and ran into Barr who stated he wanted to see her next time he came."

---

## PART 8: WHAT THE BLACKOUT MEANS

### Summary of Communications That DO Exist

During the Nov 14, 2018 - Feb 21, 2019 window, the corpus contains:

1. **SDNY internal emails** (dozens) -- These are government communications about investigating Epstein
2. **FBI case opening documents** (Dec 6, 2018)
3. **TECS/CBP flight records** (at least 8 flights)
4. **Financial records** -- Check register, wire transfers
5. **FBI interview transcripts** (Dec 4, 2018 victim interview)
6. **Court filings and legal correspondence**
7. **News articles forwarded within DOJ**
8. **One victim proffer documenting Epstein's criminal activity during this exact period**
9. **Lesley Groff email purchasing Moscow-to-NYC ticket** (Nov 28, 2018)

### What is MISSING

**[CORRECTED 2026-02-12]:** The gap is specifically in **Apple Mail PLIST metadata** from DS11 -- not in the actual email record. DS9 contains the full email content for this period. The PLIST gap is a technical artifact of how DS11 data was extracted, not evidence of deletion, wiping, or channel-switching. The emails exist in their original form in DS9.

### Assessment

**[CORRECTED 2026-02-12]:** The original assessment that the PLIST gap represented deliberate operational security is no longer supported. The evidence that remains valid:

1. **Post-Herald payments remain suspicious:** The $100K and $250K wires within days of the Herald publication are explicitly cited in the government's detention memo as evidence of witness tampering
2. **Victim testimony documents ongoing criminal conduct:** A victim had "subsequent interactions with Epstein... in December 2018-July 2019"
3. **Prior pattern of evidence destruction:** The documented history of removing computers, shredding directories, and lawyer-directed silence remains valid
4. **Encrypted tools were directly used by Epstein:** Signal, Confide, WhatsApp, and Telegram were all registered to his phone number (212-533-3739)
5. **Epstein operated with apparent confidence:** Rather than suggesting operational security, the DS9 emails show Epstein operating normally -- hosting foreign leaders, claiming political influence, and continuing travel and social activities without behavioral disruption

### The Indyke Flight (Jan 6, 2019)

**[RECONTEXTUALIZED]:** Darren Indyke flew with Epstein on January 6, 2019. The DS9 calendar shows this flight coincided with Ehud Barak's week-long island visit (Jan 6-12 per [EFTA00486718](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00486718.pdf): "Nili and Ehud to arrive early morning and stay for a week"). The meeting likely concerned multiple matters, not necessarily avoidance of creating records.

Multiple Epstein entities were documented as "voluntarily dissolved" -- consistent with the pre-arrest restructuring and the $31.5M "dissolution event" referenced in the investigation parameters.

## CONCLUSIONS

### 1. The "Blackout" Was a Technical Artifact, Not a Communication Silence

**[CORRECTED 2026-02-12]:** The 99-day gap in Apple Mail PLIST metadata was an artifact of the DS11 PLIST extraction methodology. DS9 contains continuous daily jeevacation@gmail.com email activity throughout the entire period. Epstein emailed prolifically from Nov 14, 2018 through Feb 21, 2019, maintaining contact with Summers, Barak, Ruemmler, Church, Groff, Kahn, Indyke, and many others. There was no communication blackout.

### 2. Alternative Channels Were Used, But Not as a Replacement

While Epstein did have registered Signal, Confide, WhatsApp, and Telegram accounts (confirmed by sex offender registry filings), the premise that these replaced email during this period is unsupported because email was never interrupted. Epstein used both email and encrypted channels as part of his normal communication pattern.

### 3. The Post-Herald Wire Transfers Remain Suspicious

The $100K wire to Aviloop LLC two days after the Herald, the $250K wire three days later, and a victim's statement that Epstein sent money "because he felt guilty for the trouble the articles caused" remain the strongest evidence of witness tampering during this period. The government's own detention memo ([EFTA00039383](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00039383.pdf)) explicitly cited these payments as evidence of witness tampering. However, the broader characterization of "panic" is not supported by his emails, which show no behavioral disruption after the Herald series.

### 4. Ongoing Criminal Conduct

A victim had "subsequent interactions with Epstein... in December 2018-July 2019" including sexual abuse in Florida and the Virgin Islands. Epstein asked this victim "to meet with a young (18/19) girl for coffee in Russia." The sex trafficking operation continued through this period and beyond.

### 5. Epstein Operated with Apparent Impunity

Rather than "going dark," the DS9 evidence reveals Epstein continued operating with full confidence during the period when SDNY was secretly building its case. While prosecutors were writing "on the d/l for now," Epstein was hosting Ehud Barak for a week on his island (Jan 6-12), claiming to be consulted on Treasury Secretary replacements (Dec 25 to Summers), planning Davos attendance (Dec 26), distributing Apple Watches to Bannon and others, holding strategy calls with Ruemmler (Dec 3), coordinating Moscow travel, and brokering a Barak-Qatar meeting (Dec 18).
