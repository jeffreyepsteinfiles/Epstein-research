## WHAT THE DOCUMENTS DO NOT CONTAIN

For the record, after processing 9,184+ documents:

1. **NO evidence of "satanic rituals"** - This appears only in conspiracy theory emails SENT TO the FBI
2. **NO credible evidence of "baby eating" or cannibalism** - **[CORRECTED 2026-02-12]:** One FBI FD-302 ([EFTA01246048](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA01246048.pdf)) documents cannibalism claims from an interviewee whom the FBI assessed as having "some degree of possible mental illness or emotional instability" who "was unable to provide any supporting or corroborating evidence." This is a documented FBI interview, not merely a crank email, but the FBI clearly did not treat the claims as credible
3. **NO evidence of "pizza" codewords** - Not present in any DOJ document
4. **NO evidence of "adrenochrome harvesting"** - Conspiracy theory, not in documents

What IS documented:
- Sex trafficking of minors
- Systematic rape and sexual assault
- Financial fraud and money laundering
- Witness tampering and evidence destruction
- Powerful people abusing trafficking victims
