## PART 1: THE GABRIELA RICO JIMENEZ INCIDENT -- VERIFIED FACTS

### What Happened
On **August 3, 2009**, a 21-year-old woman identified as Gabriela Rico Jimenez was filmed outside the **Fiesta Inn hotel in Monterrey, Nuevo Leon, Mexico**. In the video, which was picked up by local television and later circulated widely online, she is barefoot, visibly distressed, and making a series of extraordinary claims.

### What She Said on Video
- "They ate a person. They ate a person. I was unaware. I wanted freedom."
- She made accusations against "global elites" and specifically named **Carlos Slim**, the Mexican telecommunications billionaire, accusing him and others of involvement in ritualistic abuse and cannibalism.
- She referenced what she described as a private or "elite" event at the hotel.

### What Happened After
- Police officers arrived and arrested her at the scene.
- Authorities attributed her behavior to a **mental breakdown**.
- She was taken away by police. After this point, **no verified public record** confirms her subsequent fate.
- No hospital reports, court documents, psychiatric records, missing-person filings, or follow-up investigations have ever surfaced publicly.
- Her family has remained silent.
- Mexican authorities have not released updated statements addressing her fate.

### Verification Status
- **Her identity as a professional model is unverified.** No modeling agency, portfolio, or professional record has been confirmed by independent reporting.
- **Her claims have never been corroborated** by forensic evidence, law enforcement investigation, or witness testimony.
- **Her disappearance has not been classified as suspicious** by any known official record.
- Multiple fact-checkers (Factually.co, Distractify) have examined this case and consistently found no proof substantiating her allegations.

## PART 2: WHERE WAS JEFFREY EPSTEIN IN AUGUST 2009?

### Timeline Reconstruction from DOJ Files

**June 30, 2008:** Epstein was convicted of procuring a person under the age of 18 for prostitution in Palm Beach County, Florida. (Source: [EFTA00038251](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00038251.pdf), [EFTA00023059](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00023059.pdf))

**October 2008:** Epstein began a work-release program, spending 12 hours a day at the "Florida Science Foundation," an entity he had recently incorporated, co-located at a West Palm Beach attorney's office. (Source: [EFTA00023059](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00023059.pdf), [EFTA00011475](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00011475.pdf), [EFTA00013359](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00013359.pdf))

**July 22, 2009:** Epstein was released from the Palm Beach County Stockade. He sent an email at 5:27:50 AM (GMT-7) stating simply: **"free and home"** (Source: [EFTA00015064](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00015064.pdf), from jeevacation@gmail.com). The Palm Beach Daily News confirmed the release occurred "shortly after 6 a.m. Wednesday" (Source: [EFTA00031937](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00031937.pdf)).

**Post-Release Conditions (July 2009 - August 2010):**
- One year of supervised probation
- Must register as a sex offender
- Mandatory curfew from 10 p.m. to 6 a.m.
- No unsupervised contact with minors
- No electronic monitoring device (Source: [EFTA00031937](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00031937.pdf))
- He was in Palm Beach/New York during this period

### Critical Finding: Epstein Was NOT in Mexico in August 2009

Epstein was released from a Florida county jail on July 22, 2009, approximately **12 days before** the Jimenez incident in Monterrey on August 3, 2009. He was under supervised probation with a mandatory nightly curfew in Florida. There is **no evidence in any DOJ document** that Epstein traveled to Mexico at any point in 2009, let alone in August 2009. His first documented international travel after release was much later -- a September 2016 trip to Paris, France, which the FBI tracked with a Child Sex Tourism Travel Advisory sent to Legat Paris (Source: [EFTA00038251](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00038251.pdf)).

## PART 3: MEXICO CONNECTIONS IN THE EPSTEIN DOJ FILES

### A. FBI "Lead Forwarded to Legat Mexico City, Mexico"

The FBI's 2019 case index for the Epstein investigation (Case 50D-NY-3027571-FA) contains **two entries** titled:
- "(U) Lead Forwared to Legat Mexico City, Mexico" [sic -- "Forwared" is the FBI's own typo]

These appear in [EFTA02730741](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2012/EFTA02730741.pdf) and [EFTA02730486](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2012/EFTA02730486.pdf), both of which are serial report indices for the 2019 federal investigation. The entries appear among dozens of victim interviews, device extractions, search warrants, and administrative subpoenas from the July-November 2019 investigation period.

**What "Legat" means:** "Legat" is FBI shorthand for Legal Attache -- FBI agents stationed at U.S. embassies abroad. The FBI has Legal Attache offices in approximately 63 countries. A "Lead Forwarded to Legat Mexico City" is a standard investigative step meaning the FBI's New York office identified a lead requiring follow-up in Mexico and forwarded it to the Mexico City office for action.

**Full corpus update (2026-02-12) -- Substance now revealed:** [EFTA01250170](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA01250170.pdf) (DS9) discloses the substance of these leads. A tipster named Kenneth Darrell Turner claimed that Richard Marcinko (former U.S. Navy SEAL team commander) was in custody in Mexico City on child sex ring charges. Turner claimed a Mexican law enforcement official known as "Jorge" possessed video of Epstein engaging in sex acts with minors. Turner made increasingly sensational claims over 19+ documents ([EFTA00164990](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00164990.pdf)-[EFTA00165128](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00165128.pdf)) including alleged involvement of a former U.S. Ambassador to Mexico, but "has remained in contact with the author on an infrequent basis and has yet to provide any evidence of his claims." The FBI forwarded the lead to Legat Mexico City for verification but the file contains no resolution.

**These leads have no connection to the Jimenez incident.** Turner's claims involve different locations (Mexico City, Juarez, Cancun), different timeframes (2010-2019), different people, and different allegations.

### B. Flight Records -- Aircraft to Mexico

**N212JE (Gulfstream G550):** The only documented Mexico destination for this aircraft is a flight declaration for **February 26, 2021** -- from Chino, California to **Cabo San Lucas, Mexico**. (Source: [EFTA00011531](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00011531.pdf), [EFTA00010620](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00010620.pdf)). This was AFTER the aircraft had been sold by Epstein's estate: Lawrence Visoski (on behalf of Plan D LLC) sold N212JE to Six G Aviation LLC on December 22, 2020, who sold it the same day to N550GP LLC. This flight had nothing to do with Epstein.

**N908JE (Boeing 727 -- the so-called "Lolita Express"):** Flight manifests in the database ([EFTA00019441](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00019441.pdf), [EFTA00019442](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00019442.pdf), [EFTA00019444](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00019444.pdf)) show routes between Palm Beach (PBI), Teterboro (TEB), Santa Fe (SFR), and other U.S. destinations. **No Mexico destinations appear in any manifest for this aircraft.**

**N120JE / N722JE (Sikorsky S-76C++ helicopter):** Registration and sale records only. No Mexico flight records found.

### C. Cancun References

**Full corpus update (2026-02-12):** "Cancun" appears in 331 documents across DS4/DS8/DS9/DS10/DS11, substantially more than the single reference initially identified. Key findings:

- **Epstein personal charges:** [EFTA01671962](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01671962.pdf) (DS10) -- American Express statements show Epstein made personal charges at Cancun Airport in December 2014 (airport fees, Starbucks).
- **Victim wires:** [EFTA00172125](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00172125.pdf) (DS9) -- A minor victim (Jane Doe #7) received a Western Union wire of $350 to Cancun on 06/02/2005. FBI 302 interview ([EFTA00269550](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00269550.pdf)) confirms the victim "was on her senior high school trip in Cancun, Mexico, and called Epstein because she needed some money."
- **Travel scheduling:** Groff calendars ([EFTA00285019](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00285019.pdf), [EFTA00285325](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00285325.pdf), [EFTA00285514](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00285514.pdf)) show multiple women booked on Cancun flights in 2014, 2017, 2018, and 2019.

While Epstein and his circle had real connections to Cancun, **none of these references connect to the 2009 Jimenez incident** in Monterrey, which is 900+ km away.

### D. "New Mexico" vs. "Mexico"

The vast majority of "Mexico" references in the Epstein files actually refer to **New Mexico** -- specifically Epstein's Zorro Ranch property near Santa Fe, New Mexico, USA. This was one of Epstein's four primary residences where abuse occurred (along with New York, Palm Beach, and the U.S. Virgin Islands). Multiple indictment documents, victim statements, and Maxwell charging documents reference "New York, Florida, and New Mexico" as the charged locations (Source: [EFTA00016157](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00016157.pdf), [EFTA00021834](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00021834.pdf), [EFTA00024547](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00024547.pdf), [EFTA00028753](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00028753.pdf), etc.).

### E. Carlos Slim

**Full corpus update (2026-02-12):** "Carlos Slim" appears in 51 documents across DS9/DS10/DS11, but all references are incidental. These include: a flirtatious joke ("Shall I marry you or Carlos Slim?" per [EFTA00667648](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00667648.pdf)); Epstein attending the 2013 Milken Institute Global Conference where Slim appeared on a panel; a third-party contact chain via James Tagg about a physicist with "contacts to Carlos Slim" ([EFTA00664250](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00664250.pdf)); a connections web listing Slim as a target for philanthropic outreach ([EFTA01104262](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA01104262.pdf)); and a real estate comparison noting Slim's $75M house was for sale near a property Epstein was eyeing ([EFTA00990676](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00990676.pdf)). There is **no evidence of any personal relationship, communication, meeting, or direct connection** between Epstein and Slim. The initial finding of zero results was from a smaller database subset; the conclusion remains unchanged.

### F. Direct Searches for Jimenez-Related Terms

## PART 4: WHY THIS STORY RESURFACED

In early 2026, the U.S. Department of Justice released a new batch of Epstein-related documents. Social media users drew connections between:

1. The Jimenez video (2009) -- a woman outside a Mexican luxury hotel alleging elite cannibalism
2. The newly released documents -- revealing the scope of Epstein's sex trafficking operation
3. The FBI's "Lead Forwarded to Legat Mexico City" -- suggesting an FBI investigative connection to Mexico

The viral narrative implied that Jimenez had been a witness to or victim of Epstein-adjacent crimes in Mexico, and that her disappearance was connected to the Epstein network. Multiple outlets (LatestLY, IBTimes UK, Distractify, NewsX) covered the resurgence while noting the lack of substantiating evidence.

---

## PART 5: HONEST ASSESSMENT

### What the evidence shows:

1. **Gabriela Rico Jimenez made extraordinary claims in August 2009 outside a hotel in Monterrey, Mexico.** The claims involved cannibalism and elite abuse. She was arrested by police and has not been reliably accounted for since.

2. **Jeffrey Epstein was physically incapable of being involved in any August 2009 event in Mexico.** He was released from a Florida county jail on July 22, 2009, was under supervised probation with a nightly curfew, and was required to register as a sex offender. No travel records, emails, or any other evidence place him outside of Florida/New York during this period.

3. **The FBI did forward investigative leads to its Mexico City Legal Attache office in 2019.** However, this occurred during the post-arrest investigation (July-November 2019) and the substance of these leads is unknown and redacted. This is a standard FBI procedure -- the 2019 investigation generated leads forwarded to FBI offices worldwide (the case index in [EFTA00006107](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%204/EFTA00006107.pdf) shows leads sent to dozens of field offices and international Legats). The Mexico City leads could relate to any number of investigative threads, including financial records, travel patterns, or witness locations.

4. **There is no mention of Gabriela Rico Jimenez or the Fiesta Inn in any of the 1,380,937 DOJ documents examined across all 12 datasets.** While "Carlos Slim" (51 hits), "Monterrey" (26 hits), and "Cannibalism" (7 hits) appear in the full corpus, none of these references connect to the Jimenez incident. Not in OCR text, not in redacted/hidden text, not in image analysis.

5. **The documented Mexico connections in Epstein's network are:**
   - Epstein's personal AmEx charges at Cancun Airport in December 2014
   - A minor victim wired $350 to Cancun in June 2005 while on a school trip
   - Multiple women in his circle booked on Cancun flights in 2014, 2017, 2018, and 2019
   - A post-estate-sale flight of the former N212JE to Cabo San Lucas in February 2021 (unrelated to Epstein)
   - Two FBI investigative leads forwarded to Legat Mexico City in 2019, now revealed as the Turner/Marcinko tip (unverified claims, no connection to Jimenez)

6. **Epstein's documented abuse locations were:** New York City, Palm Beach (Florida), Santa Fe (New Mexico, USA), London (England), Paris (France), and the U.S. Virgin Islands. Mexico does not appear as a location in any charging document, victim statement, or investigative summary.

### Conclusion:

**There is no evidence connecting the Gabriela Rico Jimenez incident to Jeffrey Epstein or his network.** The temporal overlap (Epstein's release 12 days before the Jimenez incident) is coincidental -- Epstein was under court-ordered supervision in Florida at the time. The FBI's Mexico City leads from 2019 are unexplained but appear in a case index alongside hundreds of other investigative steps and provide no basis for linking to a 2009 incident in Monterrey.

The resurgence of interest in the Jimenez case following the 2026 Epstein document release appears to be driven by thematic similarity (elite abuse allegations) and the presence of "Mexico" in the FBI case index, rather than by any substantive connection found in the documents themselves. Responsible reporting on this case should note that **no fact-checker or investigative journalist has identified any evidence linking these two cases**, and the Jimenez incident remains an isolated, unresolved event with no corroborating evidence for the claims made in the video.
