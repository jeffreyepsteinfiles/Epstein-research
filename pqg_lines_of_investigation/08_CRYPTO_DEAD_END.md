# Line of Investigation 08: The Cryptocurrency Gap

## Executive Summary

The Prosecutorial Query Graph contains exactly one subpoena categorized as "Cryptocurrency / Fintech" — a grand jury demand to Iterative Capital / Iterative OTC LLC. It produced zero returns. But the subpoena is not from the Epstein case at all: it carries USAO Reference No. 2018R01689, cites wire fraud statutes (18 U.S.C. sections 1343, 1349), and relates to a standalone cryptocurrency fraud prosecution of Jon Barry Thompson. It ended up in the EFTA corpus because SDNY's document production swept in related case materials.

**The Epstein investigation issued zero cryptocurrency-specific subpoenas.** Not one rider clause, across all 257 subpoenas, mentions bitcoin, cryptocurrency, blockchain, digital currency, or virtual currency. Yet the corpus contains 2,429 documents and 3,841 pages showing Epstein's active engagement with the crypto world from 2011 onward — including proposals for crypto mining companies, tax optimization via exchanges, discussions with US Treasury officials about digital currency regulation, and a suggestion to Vladimir Putin to create a state cryptocurrency.

## 1. The Iterative Capital Subpoena: A Different Case

The sole "Cryptocurrency / Fintech" subpoena ([EFTA00102639](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00102639.pdf)) was issued January 16, 2019 — six months before Epstein's arrest.

### Rider Text

> *"With respect to Iterative Capital / Iterative OTC LLC's arbitration proceeding against Volantis Escrow Platform LLC and Volantis Market Making LLC, please provide all discovery productions made and received by any party in the proceeding, any transcripts of arbitration proceedings including depositions, and any documents filed in the arbitration proceeding by any party or by the arbitrator."*

### Why This Is Not an Epstein Subpoena

| Feature | Iterative Capital | Epstein Investigation |
|---------|------------------|----------------------|
| USAO Reference | **2018R01689** | **2019R01059** |
| Statutes | 18 U.S.C. 1343, 1349 (wire fraud) | 18 U.S.C. 1591 (sex trafficking) |
| Date | January 16, 2019 | August-October 2019 cluster |
| Subject matter | Arbitration re Volantis crypto fraud | Banking/telecom/travel records |
| AUSA | Drew Skinner | Maurene Comey, Alison Moe, et al. |

SDNY news clips within the corpus ([EFTA00018441](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00018441.pdf):p15, [EFTA00018466](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00018466.pdf):p20-21) document the underlying case: Jon Barry Thompson, principal of Volantis, was arrested July 2019 for allegedly stealing $7 million via fake Bitcoin transactions.

The subpoena's presence in the EFTA corpus reflects the broad scope of SDNY's document production, which captured materials from overlapping case files — not any connection between Epstein and the Volantis fraud.

## 2. Square / Cash App: The Nearest Miss

The closest the Epstein investigation came to fintech was two subpoenas to **Square, Inc.** (Cash App's parent company):

| EFTA | Date | Clauses | Returns |
|------|------|---------|---------|
| [EFTA00123491](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00123491.pdf) | August 17, 2019 | 13 | Zero |
| [EFTA00123518](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00123518.pdf) | August 21, 2019 | 13 | Zero |

These subpoenas were categorized as "Technology Company" and demanded standard subscriber records for Cash App accounts linked to specific phone numbers: subscriber information, session logs, IP addresses, payment records, and customer service notes. The rider language is identical to the boilerplate used for telecoms and social media platforms. Neither subpoena mentions cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, wallet addresses, or blockchain transactions — despite Cash App's Bitcoin trading feature.

Both subpoenas produced zero returns in the EFTA corpus. The PQG flagged both as HIGH severity UNFULFILLED_DEMAND gaps.

## 3. What No Subpoena Ever Asked

Across all 257 subpoenas:

- **Zero subpoenas to any cryptocurrency exchange** (Coinbase, Kraken, Binance, Gemini, etc.)
- **Zero subpoenas to any blockchain analytics firm** (Chainalysis, Elliptic, CipherTrace)
- **Zero rider clauses mentioning cryptocurrency, bitcoin, blockchain, digital currency, or virtual currency** in any financial institution subpoena
- **Zero requests for wallet addresses, private keys, or on-chain transaction records** from any entity

The 52 Financial Institution subpoenas targeted conventional banks exclusively. The 8 Money Transfer Service subpoenas went to Western Union. The investigation's financial framework was comprehensive for traditional banking but entirely absent for digital assets.

## 4. What the Corpus Reveals About Epstein's Crypto Involvement

The full text corpus tells a different story from the subpoena record. **2,429 documents** and **3,841 pages** contain references to bitcoin, cryptocurrency, coinbase, or blockchain. This material falls into several categories:

### A. Early Bitcoin Engagement (2011)

The earliest documented crypto connection is from June 2011, when Bitcoin was trading under $20:

> *"Reminder: you want to fly Amir with Bitcoin in to NY this week"*
> — Staff email to Epstein, [EFTA02020736](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA02020736.pdf)

### B. Brock Pierce Relationship (2011-2014)

Brock Pierce — who later became chairman of the Bitcoin Foundation — maintained a substantive relationship with Epstein involving specific financial proposals:

- **September 2011** ([EFTA01989757](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01989757.pdf)): Pierce to Epstein, Subject "Virtual Currency / Goods" — *"I believe I found a way to provide monetary control, tax optimization, and effectively manage earnings through the use of an exchange, insurance, and marketing."*

- **April 2014** ([EFTA01928622](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01928622.pdf)): Ito to Epstein + Reid Hoffman, Subject "MIT BitCoin project" — *"I'm involved in this. This should be interesting."*

- **July 2014** ([EFTA01916567](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01916567.pdf)): Epstein and Ito discussing "the beginning of the end for bitcoin 1.0, 2.0 could be a home run" — extensive discussion of creating alternative currencies, "Media Lab coin"

- **August 2014** ([EFTA02099970](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA02099970.pdf)): Staff scheduling memo — *"Joi Ito and Anne with the US Treasury have set up a call for Oct. 15th... topics: MIT BitCoin Project, how decentralized VC could evolve over time, outstanding technical, economic, and regulatory [issues]"*

- **December 2014** ([EFTA01746562](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01746562.pdf)): Larry Summers to Joi Ito, cc Epstein — *"Bitcoin at your convenience. Do use me as an advisor."* Ito: *"Would love to connect again and introduce you to my bitcoin kids."*

### D. Geopolitical Ambitions (2014)

It would be the most advanced financial instrument available on a global basis"*

### E. Silk Road Interest (2013)

## 5. The Gap

The contrast between the subpoena record and the corpus evidence is stark:

| Dimension | Subpoena Record | Corpus Evidence |
|-----------|----------------|-----------------|
| Crypto subpoenas from Epstein case | 0 | — |
| Crypto mentions in any rider clause | 0 | — |
| Epstein's earliest crypto engagement | Not investigated | June 2011 |
| Named crypto contacts | Not investigated | Brock Pierce, Joi Ito, Steven Sinofsky, Larry Summers, Reid Hoffman |
| Financial proposals involving crypto | Not investigated | Tax optimization via exchanges (Pierce, 2011), crypto mining company (Pierce, 2013), Media Lab coin (Ito, 2014) |
| US Treasury consultation on crypto | Not investigated | Documented for October 2014 |
| Crypto interest through final months | Not investigated | Bannon-Epstein chats through June 2019 |

The corpus documents Epstein's engagement with cryptocurrency from 2011 through 2019. No grand jury subpoenas related to cryptocurrency were issued in the Epstein investigation. Whether prosecutors pursued crypto-related inquiries through other channels is not documented in the corpus.

---

## 6. What Cannot Be Determined

1. Whether prosecutors investigated Epstein's crypto exposure through channels not reflected in grand jury subpoenas (e.g., informal cooperation from exchanges, blockchain analytics without subpoena)
2. Whether the FBI's forensic examination of Epstein's 60+ seized devices included wallet file searches or crypto application analysis
3. Whether any of Epstein's documented crypto discussions resulted in actual holdings, wallet creation, or transactions
4. Whether Pierce's 2011 "tax optimization" proposal was implemented
