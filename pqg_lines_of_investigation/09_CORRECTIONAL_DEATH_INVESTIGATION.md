# Line of Investigation 09: Correctional Records Gaps and the Death Investigation

## Executive Summary

Between August 12 and August 20, 2019, the SDNY grand jury issued at least 24 subpoenas targeting the Metropolitan Correctional Center and its personnel in connection with Jeffrey Epstein's death on August 10, 2019. Six institutional subpoenas to MCC -- containing 42 individual demand clauses covering emails, personal device contents, privilege logs, custodian testimony, and an explicit anti-spoliation demand -- produced zero identifiable returns in the 2.7-million-page EFTA corpus. This represents the single largest unfulfilled-demand cluster in the entire prosecutorial query graph. Among the individual MCC staff subpoenas, four of seven named officers (Perry Joyner, Michael Davis, R. Silvia, Samantha DiMisa) show zero matched returns; Tova Noel produced 3 of 19 clauses (all LOW confidence, matching internal DOJ emails about the subpoenas rather than actual responsive documents); and the only subpoena that directly probed post-death records destruction -- issued to Michael Kearins on August 20 -- shows generic email matches but no substantive findings on the destruction question itself. The OIG Report ([EFTA01656708](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01656708.pdf), 128 pages) and FBI briefing documents confirm that roughly half of MCC's 150 cameras were not recording due to a DVR hard drive failure discovered two days before Epstein's death, that only two cameras in the SHU vicinity were functional, that guards Noel and Thomas falsified round sheets, and that no staff or individuals were captured approaching Epstein's tier between approximately 10:40 p.m. on August 9 and 6:30 a.m. on August 10. Yet the raw institutional records underlying these findings -- the round sheets, DVR maintenance logs, staff communications, cellphone data, and privilege logs -- are absent from the public production.

## 1. Subpoena Timeline: Four Phases of Investigative Urgency

The correctional subpoena record divides into four distinct phases, each revealing escalating prosecutorial concern.

### Phase 1: Pre-Death (July 11, 2019)

Four subpoenas to MCC demanded telephone call recordings for July 6-11, 2019, excluding attorney communications (Marc Fernich, Martin Weinberg, Reid Weingarten). These pre-date Epstein's death by a full month and relate to the sex trafficking prosecution, not the death investigation.

| EFTA | Target | Clauses |
|------|--------|---------|
| [EFTA00076121](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00076121.pdf) | Metropolitan Correctional Center | 0 (rider-only) |
| [EFTA00096034](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00096034.pdf) | Metropolitan Correctional Center | 3 |
| [EFTA00096040](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00096040.pdf) | Metropolitan Correctional Center | 1 |
| [EFTA01687368](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01687368.pdf) | Metropolitan Correctional Center | 1 |

### Phase 2: Immediate Response (August 12, 2019 -- 2 Days Post-Death)

A FORTHWITH subpoena ([EFTA00078450](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00078450.pdf)) plus individual subpoenas to Perry Joyner, Michael Davis, and Clyde Washington -- all demanding death-night location and activity evidence. Each officer received a different time-window demand, reconstructing the shift schedule:

| Individual | EFTA | Time Window | Shift Interpretation |
|-----------|------|-------------|---------------------|
| Perry Joyner | [EFTA01659604](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01659604.pdf) | 8 a.m. Aug 9 onward | Day shift |
| Michael Davis | [EFTA01659606](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01659606.pdf) | 2 p.m. Aug 9 onward | Afternoon |
| Clyde Washington | [EFTA01659608](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01659608.pdf) | 4 p.m. Aug 9 onward | Evening overlap |

### Phase 3: Overnight-Shift Focus (August 14-15, 2019)

Tova Noel received a FORTHWITH subpoena ([EFTA00075342](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00075342.pdf)) demanding her cellphone, all Epstein-related materials, and location/activity evidence for **7 p.m. August 9 to 12 p.m. August 10** -- the exact death-night window. Second-wave subpoenas went to R. Adams, R. Silvia, S. Shakir, and Samantha DiMisa.

### Phase 4: Institutional Demands and Destruction Probe (August 20, 2019)

Six institutional MCC subpoenas plus a subpoena to Michael Kearins specifically probing records destruction. Every institutional subpoena contained an anti-spoliation clause (Clause 4) requiring MCC to identify any documents "lost, destroyed, or discarded since January 1, 2019" and explain the circumstances of each loss.

---

## 2. MCC Institutional Subpoenas: 42 Clauses, No Matched Returns

All six MCC institutional subpoenas (August 20, 2019) show identical status: **all 42 demand clauses UNKNOWN -- zero matched returns.**

| EFTA | Clauses | Returns |
|------|---------|---------|
| [EFTA00077539](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00077539.pdf) | 7 | Zero |
| [EFTA00079269](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00079269.pdf) | 7 | Zero |
| [EFTA00083666](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00083666.pdf) | 7 | Zero |
| [EFTA00094949](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00094949.pdf) | 7 | Zero |
| [EFTA00099491](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00099491.pdf) | 7 | Zero |
| [EFTA00123514](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00123514.pdf) | 7 | Zero |

Each subpoena demanded: (1) all emails, texts, handwritten notes, and records from June 1, 2019 to present; (2) personal device contents of MCC employees; (3) electronic/native-format production; (4) identification of any destroyed records; (5) a privilege log; (6) a custodian of records designation; and (7) a designated knowledgeable employee to testify before the Grand Jury on search completeness. No privilege log, no custodian testimony, and no destruction accounting appear anywhere in the released corpus.

---

## 3. Individual Officer Returns: Nominal Compliance at Best

| Individual | Clauses | Fulfilled | Unfulfilled | Unknown | Quality |
|-----------|---------|-----------|-------------|---------|---------|
| Clyde Washington (2 subpoenas) | 17 | 12 | 4 | 0 | LOW confidence |
| Tova Noel (2 subpoenas) | 19 | 3 | 16 | 0 | LOW confidence |
| FORTHWITH [likely Thomas] | 10 | 7 | 1 | 2 | LOW confidence |
| Michael Kearins | 9 | 7 | 2 | 0 | LOW confidence |
| Perry Joyner | 9 | 0 | 0 | 9 | Zero returns |
| Michael Davis | 9 | 0 | 0 | 9 | Zero returns |
| R. Silvia (2 subpoenas) | 16 | 0 | 0 | 16 | Zero returns |
| Samantha DiMisa | 8 | 0 | 0 | 8 | Zero returns |

All "fulfilled" entries are LOW confidence because matching linked them to internal DOJ emails circulating copies of the subpoenas -- not to actual responsive documents produced by the officers. The Noel cellphone demand (Clause 10) is explicitly unfulfilled; no evidence exists that her phone was surrendered or its contents produced.

---

## 4. The Kearins Records-Destruction Probe

Michael Kearins was subpoenaed on August 20, 2019 ([EFTA00092961](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00092961.pdf)) with a clause found in no other MCC officer subpoena:

> *"All materials related to any destruction of records at the Metropolitan Correctional Center after the August 10, 2019 death of Jeffrey Epstein, including, but not limited to, any text messages, emails, or other communications."*

The subpoena sought evidence regarding whether records destruction had occurred — a standard investigative step in custodial death investigations. The fulfillment evidence shows only generic email matches (at [EFTA01659601](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01659601.pdf), [EFTA01659604](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01659604.pdf), [EFTA01659608](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01659608.pdf)), not substantive findings about the destruction itself. Whether the probe yielded affirmative evidence of spoliation cannot be determined from the released corpus.

## 5. The DVR2 Failure: Camera System Timeline

Multiple FBI briefing documents and the OIG Report reconstruct the surveillance camera failure. MCC had approximately 150 cameras (no audio) throughout the institution, with roughly 11 in and around the SHU.

| Date | Event | Source |
|------|-------|--------|
| July 29, 2019 | DVR2 hard disk failure. ~75 cameras stop recording. Live feeds continue. | [EFTA01656152](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01656152.pdf) p.12 |
| August 8, 2019 | BOP learns DVR2 is not recording (10 days after failure). | [EFTA01656152](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01656152.pdf) p.12 |
| August 8-9, 2019 | Electronics Technician arrives. SIS Lieutenant assumes he will work overtime to fix it. "Miscommunication" -- technician does not stay. | [EFTA01656708](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01656708.pdf) pp.87-91 |
| August 10, 2019 | DVR2 still not recording at time of death. Only 2 SHU-area cameras recording to DVR1. | [EFTA01656708](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01656708.pdf) p.91 |

The OIG found that one of the two functional cameras captured the SHU common area, Officers' Station, and stairways to tiers including Epstein's tier. Over 400 hours of video from July 23 to August 10 were reviewed, and the recorded video "did not identify any staff or other individuals approaching Epstein's SHU tier from the common area" between approximately 10:40 p.m. on August 9 and 6:30 a.m. on August 10.

## 6. The OIG Report and Warden Interview

The 128-page OIG Report ([EFTA01656708](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01656708.pdf), June 2023) is the primary death investigation document in the corpus. Key findings:

- Epstein was removed from suicide watch on July 24 but remained under psychological observation until July 30.
- Psychology staff required Epstein to have a cellmate "at all times." His cellmate was transferred out and not replaced.
- SHU inmates were locked in cells at approximately 8 p.m. on August 9.
- Head counts were not conducted 5 times between July 23 and August 9; CO Michael Thomas worked 2 of those 5 shifts.
- Noel and Thomas browsed the internet, sat at their desk, and moved around the SHU common area instead of conducting mandated rounds, then signed false certifications.
- The Medical Examiner found injuries consistent with suicide by hanging, no defensive wounds, no medications or illegal substances in blood toxicology, no marks on hands, broken fingernails, or debris under them.

A separate audio recording ([EFTA00135578](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00135578.pdf), 12.8 minutes) captures the OIG interview of the MCC Warden on August 12, 2019. The Warden stated: "We weren't told that he was going to be coming to the institution. When he initially came, he was dropped off on the weekend." He confirmed the Regional Director (Mr. Ormont) ordered Epstein kept in SHU, overriding normal evaluation. On cellmate selection: "We came up with Tartaglione, who was in there. White male, probably be able to cope with him."

## 7. The Noel/Thomas Indictment and Case Disposition

On November 19, 2019, a federal grand jury returned an indictment ([EFTA00010968](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00010968.pdf), 20 pages) charging:

- **Tova Noel**: 5 counts 18 U.S.C. 1001(a)(3) (False Records) + 1 count 18 U.S.C. 371 (Conspiracy)
- **Michael Thomas**: 3 counts 18 U.S.C. 1001(a)(3) + 1 count 18 U.S.C. 371

Both self-surrendered to FBI on November 19, 2019 (confirmed at [EFTA01684193](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01684193.pdf)). The indictment describes them "repeatedly fail[ing] to perform mandated counts of prisoners" and "repeatedly sign[ing] false certifications attesting to having conducted multiple counts of inmates when, in truth and in fact, they never conducted such counts."

An internal DOJ coordination email ([EFTA01659584](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01659584.pdf), August 12, 2019) reveals at least 13 MCC employees were prioritized for interviews, that the subpoena process was coordinated between FBI and OIG from the earliest stages, and that investigators were working at high speed: "We really need to do a number of these interviews today."

## 8. What the Data Shows vs. What It Suggests

**What the data shows:**

- 42 demand clauses across 6 MCC institutional subpoenas yielded zero identifiable returns.
- 4 of 7 named individual MCC staff subpoenas yielded zero identifiable returns.
- The records-destruction probe (Kearins) produced no substantive destruction findings in the corpus.
- DVR2 failed 12 days before Epstein's death; the failure was discovered 2 days before; it was not repaired.
- Only 2 of ~11 SHU cameras were recording when Epstein died.
- BOP internal emails show post-death timeline editing and morale collapse, but no raw institutional records.

**What it suggests but cannot prove:**

- The institutional records may have been produced but withheld from the EFTA release, or may exist in the corpus but cannot be matched to the subpoenas by automated systems.
- The anti-spoliation demand in all six institutional subpoenas, combined with the Kearins destruction probe, is consistent with standard post-incident preservation demands. Whether prosecutors had specific evidence of records destruction, or were applying a prophylactic preservation standard, is not documented in the corpus.
- The OIG Report and FBI briefings clearly contain information derived from MCC records, meaning some institutional material was obtained -- but it appears filtered through investigative summaries rather than produced as raw records.

---

## 9. Records Not Identified in the Corpus

1. **Noel cellphone contents.** The Noel subpoena explicitly demanded her cellphone (Clause 10). Status: UNFULFILLED. The Noel cellphone contents are not present in the corpus.

2. **Raw round sheets.** The falsified round sheets are the evidentiary core of the Noel/Thomas prosecution. Raw round sheets are not present in the matched returns.

3. **DVR maintenance records.** The camera system failure history — work orders, repair requests, budget memos, equipment logs — would be responsive to the MCC subpoenas. DVR maintenance records are not identified in the production.

4. **Privilege logs.** All six institutional subpoenas required MCC to produce a privilege log for any withheld documents. No privilege log appears in the corpus.

5. **Kearins destruction findings.** The Kearins subpoena addressed whether records were destroyed after Epstein's death. The subpoena was answered (email matches exist), but the substantive findings are absent from the corpus.

6. **DVR2 failure communications.** Who knew about the DVR2 failure, when, and what was communicated? The OIG Report addresses this partially but the underlying communications are not identified in the corpus.

---

## 10. Questions for the Record

1. **Demand production of MCC institutional returns** (or a formal certification that none were produced) for all six August 20, 2019 subpoenas. These are government-to-government demands; no third-party privilege applies.

2. **Request the Kearins records-destruction investigation results.** The subpoena and the question it asked are public. The answer should be.

3. **Subpoena the MCC privilege log.** If MCC withheld documents under privilege, the privilege log itself is not privileged and should be producible.

4. **Request complete DVR2 failure documentation** including maintenance logs, chain-of-custody for DVR hard drives, and the electronics technician's work records for August 8-10, 2019.

5. **Request clarification on whether MCC officers produced returns** to the August 2019 death-investigation subpoenas, and if so, whether those returns are included in the EFTA production.
