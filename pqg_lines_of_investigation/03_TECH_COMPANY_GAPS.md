## Executive Summary

The SDNY grand jury issued 21 subpoenas to technology companies and 30 to telecommunications providers between July 2017 and June 2020. AT&T's returns are linked to all 13 of its subpoenas, totaling 2,623 pages. Google, Facebook, Amazon, Lyft, Square, and 4chan — a combined 16 subpoenas containing 193 demand clauses — have no matched returns anywhere in the DOJ production.

One FBI internal email ([EFTA01660712](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01660712.pdf)) explicitly states that an agent "has reached out to Amazon at least three times with no response received back." PayPal/Venmo and Oath Holdings (Yahoo) confirmed compliance by email and custodian declaration, respectively. Apple produced a 2-page return to one of its two subpoenas.

**Important caveat:** The absence of matched returns in the EFTA corpus does not necessarily indicate non-compliance by the companies themselves. Grand jury returns to tech companies often contain sensitive subscriber data subject to protective orders. These materials may have been produced to prosecutors but excluded from the public DOJ release, filed under separate case numbers, or produced under seal. The structural record contains no matched returns for 16 of 21 tech company subpoenas, but the reason for their absence cannot be determined from the available data.

## Companies With No Matched Returns

### Google, Inc. — 3 Subpoenas, 43 Demand Clauses, Zero Returns

| EFTA | Date | Clauses | Key Demand |
|------|------|---------|------------|
| [EFTA00153743](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00153743.pdf) | July 13, 2017 | 15 | All accounts associated with domain `helpfulexperts.com` |
| [EFTA00082565](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00082565.pdf) | October 23, 2019 | 14 | Standard subscriber information rider |
| [EFTA00091937](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00091937.pdf) | October 23, 2019 | 14 | Standard subscriber information rider |

The July 2017 Google subpoena is the only pre-gap subpoena in the entire production (see [Dossier 01](./01_TEMPORAL_BLACKOUT.md)). It targeted the domain `helpfulexperts.com`, requesting subscriber information, session logs, IP addresses, payment records, and investigative files. The domain does not appear elsewhere in the corpus.

The October 2019 subpoenas (issued the same day, four months after Epstein's arrest) use the same 14-clause electronic-records template but without the `helpfulexperts.com` reference. The specific email accounts targeted are not visible in the rider text.

### Facebook, Inc. — 4 Subpoenas, 52 Demand Clauses, Zero Returns

| EFTA | Date | Clauses |
|------|------|---------|
| [EFTA00079942](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00079942.pdf) | November 21, 2019 | 14 |
| [EFTA00155600](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00155600.pdf) | November 21, 2019 | 14 |
| [EFTA00079951](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00079951.pdf) | December 11, 2019 | 13 |
| [EFTA00095990](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00095990.pdf) | June 15, 2020 | 11 |

Facebook was subpoenaed across three dates spanning seven months. The November 2019 pair and the December 2019 subpoena include a clause demanding call records — "any and all call records, including incoming/outgoing calls, local/long distance usage details, all subscriber opening" — suggesting the subpoenas may have targeted Facebook Messenger or WhatsApp (both Facebook-owned platforms with calling features). The June 2020 subpoena uses an 11-clause version of the same template.

### Amazon.com, Inc. — 3 Subpoenas, 20 Demand Clauses, Zero Returns

| EFTA | Date | Clauses | Key Demand |
|------|------|---------|------------|
| [EFTA00081990](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00081990.pdf) | June 20, 2019 | 7 | Order #103-1737820-4508648; orders shipped to Epstein's addresses |
| [EFTA00082004](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00082004.pdf) | June 20, 2019 | 7 | Same as above |
| [EFTA00095995](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00095995.pdf) | June 12, 2020 | 6 | Orders shipped to Ghislaine Maxwell / Ghislaine Borgerson since Dec 1, 2019 |

The June 2019 Amazon subpoenas demand order history for a specific order number and all orders shipped to three addresses: **358 El Brillo Way, Palm Beach, FL 33480** (Epstein's Florida residence), **9 East 71st Street, New York, NY 10021** (Epstein's Manhattan mansion), and **49 Zorro Ranch Road, Stanley, NM 87056** (Epstein's New Mexico ranch).

The June 2020 subpoena shifts focus to Ghislaine Maxwell, requesting all orders shipped to "Ghislaine Maxwell, Ghislaine Borgerson, from December 1, 2019 to present" — the period when Maxwell was evading law enforcement before her July 2020 arrest.

An FBI internal email ([EFTA01660712](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01660712.pdf), August 1, 2019) states: **"[Agent] has reached out to Amazon at least three times with no response received back."**

### Lyft, Inc. — 2 Subpoenas, 30 Demand Clauses, Zero Returns

| EFTA | Date | Clauses |
|------|------|---------|
| [EFTA00079960](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00079960.pdf) | December 11, 2019 | 15 |
| [EFTA00155606](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00155606.pdf) | December 11, 2019 | 15 |

Both issued the same day with a 15-clause template including SMS/text messaging records, IP history, and login records. Ride-sharing records could map physical movements of individuals under investigation.

### Square, Inc. — 2 Subpoenas, 26 Demand Clauses, Zero Returns

| EFTA | Date | Clauses | Key Demand |
|------|------|---------|------------|
| [EFTA00123491](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00123491.pdf) | August 17, 2019 | 13 | All payment records: maker, method, payor/payee banking details, date, amount |
| [EFTA00123518](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00123518.pdf) | August 21, 2019 | 13 | Same |

Square (now Block, Inc.) processes mobile payments and peer-to-peer transfers via Cash App. The subpoenas demand all payments processed to or from specified individuals, including maker, method, and banking details.

### 4chan — 1 Subpoena, 7 Demand Clauses, Zero Returns

| EFTA | Date | Clauses | Key Demand |
|------|------|---------|------------|
| [EFTA00123462](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00123462.pdf) | August 13, 2019 | 7 | IP logs and registration info for specific post numbers |

The 4chan subpoena was issued three days after Epstein's death and demands account registration and IP address information for four specific post numbers: **222520442, 222518349, 222520257, 222518664**. These posts likely relate to the widely-reported 4chan posts that appeared shortly before or after Epstein's death was publicly announced, some claiming insider knowledge of events at MCC.

## Companies With Confirmed Returns

### Oath Holdings / Yahoo — Confirmed Response

[EFTA00152432](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00152432.pdf) (December 19, 2018): Subpoena for records on four Yahoo email accounts: `littlestjeff@yahoo.com`, `columbiadental1@yahoo.com`, `jeffreyepsteinorg@yahoo.com`, `jeeproject@yahoo.com`.

**Return confirmed at [EFTA01660718](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01660718.pdf):** Business Records Declaration from Alyssa Anderson, Custodian of Records for Oath Holdings Inc., formally responding to the December 19, 2018 subpoena. The FBI internal email at [EFTA01660712](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01660712.pdf) lists "Yahoo results" among its attachments and references an "Oath_Holdings_(Yahoo)_Results.zip" file.

Clause fulfillment: 5 FULFILLED, 4 UNFULFILLED, 5 PARTIAL.

### PayPal/Venmo — Confirmed Response

[EFTA00074427](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00074427.pdf) and [EFTA00074432](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00074432.pdf) (September 3, 2019): 15 clauses each, covering all PayPal product lines (Venmo, Credit, Working Capital, MyCash, Cash, Xoom, Braintree).

**Return confirmed at [EFTA01654093](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01654093.pdf):** Email from Ashley Betzhold, Analyst, Global Law Enforcement Fulfillment, PayPal: *"I received and fulfilled your request for records with our case reference 791064 (Jeffrey Epstein). I just wanted to reach out to let you know that I can be your point of contact for this case."*

Clause fulfillment: all 30 clauses scored PARTIAL.

### Apple — Partial Response (One of Two Subpoenas)

Two Apple subpoenas exist under slightly different names:
- [EFTA00123465](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00123465.pdf) ("Apple, Inc", August 13, 2019, 15 clauses): **No matched returns**
- [EFTA01659733](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01659733.pdf) ("Apple", undated, 12 clauses): **2-page EFTA return** + 21 House Estate concordance cross-references

The 2-page Apple return and the discrepancy between the two subpoenas' match status suggest the undated subpoena may be the one Apple responded to, while the August 2019 subpoena (with 3 additional iCloud-specific clauses) remains without an identifiable return.

### Microsoft — House Estate Concordance Only

[EFTA00152138](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00152138.pdf) (December 19, 2018): Subpoena for `jeffreyepstein@live.com`. The PQG identified 35 House Estate concordance cross-references ([HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_010735](https://archive.org/download/Epstein_Estate_Documents_-_Seventh_Production/IMAGES/001/HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_010735.jpg) through [HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_031716](https://archive.org/download/Epstein_Estate_Documents_-_Seventh_Production/IMAGES/011/HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_031716.jpg)) but no direct EFTA production from Microsoft.

## Telecommunications Comparison

The telecom sector shows a similarly uneven pattern:

| Provider | Subpoenas | Matched Returns | Pages Produced |
|----------|-----------|----------------|----------------|
| **AT&T** | 13 | **13 (100%)** | **2,623** |
| Comcast | 1 | 1 (weak match) | Unknown |
| Verizon Legal Compliance | 1 | 1 (weak match) | Unknown |
| T-Mobile | 7 | 0 | 0 |
| Sprint | 2 | 0 | 0 |
| Verizon | 5 | 0 | 0 |
| Verizon Wireless | 1 | 0 | 0 |

The FBI email at [EFTA01660712](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01660712.pdf) provides important context: Verizon returned "Negative results — redirect to T-Mobile," and T-Mobile returned "Negative results — redirect to AT&T." This redirect chain indicates the underlying phone numbers were ported between carriers, with subscriber data ultimately residing at AT&T. This number-portability chain likely explains a significant portion of the zero-return pattern for Verizon, T-Mobile, and Sprint — these carriers may have had no responsive records because the accounts had been ported. AT&T, as the final carrier holding the ported numbers, produced 2,623 pages across all 13 of its subpoenas (returned August 5, 2020).

## What Was Demanded

The tech company subpoenas share a common template with the following data categories:

| Data Category | Companies Demanding It |
|---------------|----------------------|
| Subscriber information (name, address, DOB) | All |
| IP addresses and session logs | All except PayPal |
| Payment/billing records | All |
| Account notes and correspondence | Google, Facebook, Apple, Microsoft, Oath, Lyft, Square |
| SSN/DOB | Google, Facebook, Apple, Microsoft, Oath, Lyft |
| Call records | Facebook, Apple, Lyft |
| Order/transaction history | Amazon, Square, PayPal |
| Investigative files/complaints | Google, Facebook, Apple, Microsoft, Oath, Lyft |

Three subpoenas contain unique, investigation-specific demands:

1. **Google (July 2017):** All accounts associated with `helpfulexperts.com`
2. **Amazon (June 2019):** Specific order number and all shipments to three Epstein properties
3. **4chan (August 2019):** IP and registration data for four specific post numbers

---

## Combined Non-Response Statistics

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Tech subpoenas without returns | 16 of 21 (76.2%) |
| Telecom subpoenas without returns | 15 of 30 (50.0%) |
| Combined tech+telecom without returns | 31 of 51 (60.8%) |
| Demand clauses with UNKNOWN fulfillment (tech, no returns) | 193 |
| Demand clauses with UNKNOWN fulfillment (telecom, no returns) | 76 |
| **Total unfulfilled demand clauses** | **269** |

---

## Structural Observations

1. **Return visibility in the corpus is company-specific, not sector-wide.** AT&T's 2,623 pages are fully represented in the EFTA corpus; T-Mobile and Verizon show no matched returns, though the number-portability redirect chain substantially explains their negatives. PayPal confirmed compliance by email; Amazon was contacted three times with no response per FBI documentation. The variation may reflect differences in how returns were filed, processed, or included in the public release, as well as differences in actual responsiveness.

2. **Duplicate subpoenas are common.** Google received 2 subpoenas on October 23, 2019; Facebook received 2 on November 21, 2019; Lyft received 2 on December 11, 2019; PayPal/Venmo received 2 on September 3, 2019. These pairs typically share identical clause counts and templates. They may represent subpoenas to different legal-compliance offices, or duplicates across production batches.

3. **The Amazon non-response is the only one documented in the corpus.** The FBI's explicit notation that Amazon was contacted "at least three times with no response" ([EFTA01660712](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01660712.pdf)) is unique. No similar notation exists for Google, Facebook, Lyft, Square, or 4chan.

4. **The 4chan subpoena timing is significant.** Issued August 13, 2019 — three days after Epstein's death — targeting four specific post numbers, it indicates FBI awareness of the online discussion about Epstein's death in real time and a desire to identify the posters.

5. **The production may be incomplete for structural reasons.** As noted in the executive summary, grand jury returns to tech companies often contain sensitive subscriber data subject to protective orders. These materials may have been produced to prosecutors but excluded from the public DOJ release. The absence of returns in the EFTA corpus does not necessarily mean the companies failed to comply.
