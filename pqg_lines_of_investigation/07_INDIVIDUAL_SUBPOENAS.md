# Line of Investigation 07: Individuals Under Subpoena

## Executive Summary

The SDNY grand jury subpoenaed at least 32 named and redacted individuals in connection with the Epstein investigation and the parallel MCC death investigation. These fall into three categories: Epstein's estate executors (Darren Indyke, Richard Kahn), MCC correctional officers from the night of Epstein's death, and additional redacted persons identified only by "Advice of Rights" language. No returns from the estate executors have been identified in the EFTA corpus. Among the MCC officers, six named individuals produced zero identifiable returns, while others show only LOW-confidence matches that reference copies of the subpoenas themselves rather than actual responsive documents. Meanwhile, 199 individuals with HIGH-frequency document presence — including Lesley Groff (93,634 documents), Leon Black (4,817), and Glenn Dubin (5,333) — were never subpoenaed at all. Document frequency reflects name presence in administrative records (scheduling, correspondence, etc.) and does not indicate culpability or investigative relevance.

## 1. Who Was Subpoenaed

### Category 1: Estate Executors

| Individual | EFTA | Date | Clauses | Returns |
|-----------|------|------|---------|---------|
| Darren Indyke | [EFTA00088984](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00088984.pdf) | October 18, 2019 | 8 | Zero |
| Richard Kahn | [EFTA00088989](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00088989.pdf) | October 18, 2019 | 8 | Zero |

Both received identical subpoenas demanding:

1. Instructions/definitions: production of all documents in their possession, custody, or control
2. Coverage of all responsive documents globally (US or foreign jurisdiction)
3. Definition of "the Will" = Last Will and Testament of Jeffrey E. Epstein, executed August 8, 2019
4. Request for electronic/OCR-searchable format with metadata
5. Privilege preservation clause with privilege log requirement
6. **"Any documents relating to 'The 1953 Trust,' described in the Will, executed on August 8, 2019, including but not limited to The 1953 Trust agreement itself, and any trust documents referenced or referred to within The 1953 Trust"**
7. **"Any drafts or notes of the Trust Documents"**
8. **"Any communications relating to the Trust Documents"**

The 1953 Trust — named for Epstein's birth year — was the vehicle through which Epstein's assets were structured. As co-executors of the estate and apparent trustees, Indyke and Kahn had direct custody of the most critical financial documents in the case. Their subpoenas were issued October 18, 2019 — approximately two months after Epstein's death.

Zero production has been identified in the EFTA corpus. The PQG classifies both as HIGH-severity UNFULFILLED_DEMAND gaps (gap IDs 41 and 42). Estate executor subpoenas typically involve extensive privilege negotiations, and the corpus may not capture documents produced under seal, through negotiated channels, or subject to ongoing privilege disputes.

### Category 2: MCC Officers — Death Night (August 9-10, 2019)

These subpoenas were issued within days of Epstein's death, demanding all materials relating to Epstein and — critically — documents establishing each officer's location and activities during specific time windows on the night of August 9-10, 2019.

#### Named Officers — Death Night Shifts

| Individual | EFTA | Date | Time Window Demanded | Clauses | Fulfilled |
|-----------|------|------|---------------------|---------|-----------|
| Perry Joyner | [EFTA01659604](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01659604.pdf) | Aug 12, 2019 | 8 a.m. August 9 onward | 9 | 0 (all UNKNOWN) |
| Michael Davis | [EFTA01659606](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01659606.pdf) | Aug 12, 2019 | 2 p.m. August 9 onward | 9 | 0 (all UNKNOWN) |
| Clyde Washington | [EFTA01659608](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01659608.pdf), [EFTA00092819](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00092819.pdf) | Aug 12-15, 2019 | 4 p.m. August 9 onward | 17 (2 subpoenas) | 13 (LOW confidence) |
| Tova Noel | [EFTA00075342](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00075342.pdf), [EFTA00094944](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00094944.pdf) | Aug 14, 2019 | 7 p.m. August 9 onward | 19 (2 subpoenas) | 3 (LOW) |
| [REDACTED — FORTHWITH] | [EFTA00078450](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00078450.pdf) | Aug 12, 2019 | 7 p.m. August 9 onward | 10 | 7 (LOW) |

The FORTHWITH subpoena at [EFTA00078450](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00078450.pdf) shares the same 7 p.m. time window as Tova Noel and demands immediate cellphone surrender. Cross-referencing with the Equifax subpoena ([EFTA00123521](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00123521.pdf)), which names both "Tova A. Noel" and "Michael A. Thomas" as subjects, and the AT&T composite subpoena ([EFTA00133182](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00133182.pdf)), which embeds a rider for Michael Thomas dated August 19, 2019, this FORTHWITH subpoena is almost certainly for **Michael Thomas** — the second MCC officer who was later indicted alongside Noel.

The staggered time windows reconstruct the shift schedule:
- **8 a.m.** — Perry Joyner (day shift)
- **2 p.m.** — Michael Davis (afternoon)
- **4 p.m.** — Clyde Washington (evening overlap)
- **7 p.m.** — Tova Noel and [FORTHWITH/Thomas] (overnight shift — the shift during which Epstein died)

All MCC death-night subpoenas include "Advice of Rights" language, indicating that each officer was considered a potential criminal subject, not merely a witness.

#### Named Officers — Second Wave (August 15-20, 2019)

| Individual | EFTA | Date | Clauses | Fulfilled |
|-----------|------|------|---------|-----------|
| R. Adams | [EFTA00092841](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00092841.pdf) | Aug 15, 2019 | 8 | 1 (false match) |
| R. Silvia | [EFTA00092843](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00092843.pdf), [EFTA00139741](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00139741.pdf) | Aug 15, 2019 | 16 (2 subpoenas) | 0 (all UNKNOWN) |
| S. Shakir | [EFTA00092849](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00092849.pdf), [EFTA00098155](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00098155.pdf) | Aug 15, 2019 | 16 (2 subpoenas) | 12 (LOW) |
| Samantha DiMisa | [EFTA00092851](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00092851.pdf) | Aug 15, 2019 | 8 | 0 (all UNKNOWN) |
| Michael Kearins | [EFTA00092961](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00092961.pdf) | Aug 20, 2019 | 9 | 7 (LOW) |

Michael Kearins received a uniquely worded subpoena that included a clause not present in any other MCC officer subpoena:

> *"All materials related to any destruction of records at the Metropolitan Correctional Center after the August 10, 2019 death of Jeffrey Epstein, including, but not limited to, any text messages, emails, or other communications."*

This suggests Kearins held a supervisory or administrative role, and that prosecutors had reason to believe records were destroyed after Epstein's death.

#### Redacted Officers — August 12, 2019 (Death Night Focus)

Five additional subpoenas with redacted names, all dated August 12, 2019, contain time windows spanning the death night:

| EFTA | Time Window |
|------|-----------|
| [EFTA00123547](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00123547.pdf) | 4 p.m. Aug 9 — 12 p.m. Aug 10 |
| [EFTA00123549](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00123549.pdf) | 2 p.m. Aug 9 — 12 p.m. Aug 10 |
| [EFTA00123551](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00123551.pdf) | 8 a.m. Aug 9 — 12 p.m. Aug 10 |
| [EFTA02729866](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02729866.pdf) | 2 p.m. Aug 9 — 12 p.m. Aug 10 (duplicate of [EFTA00123549](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00123549.pdf)) |
| [EFTA02729868](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02729868.pdf) | 8 a.m. Aug 9 — 12 p.m. Aug 10 (duplicate of [EFTA00123551](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00123551.pdf)) |

#### Redacted Officers — August 15, 2019 (Second Wave)

Twelve additional subpoenas with redacted names, in the [EFTA00092821](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00092821.pdf)-00092847 range, sharing the August 15 date and 8-clause format with the named second-wave officers:

[EFTA00092821](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00092821.pdf), [EFTA00092823](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00092823.pdf), [EFTA00092825](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00092825.pdf), [EFTA00092827](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00092827.pdf), [EFTA00092829](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00092829.pdf), [EFTA00092831](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00092831.pdf), [EFTA00092833](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00092833.pdf), [EFTA00092835](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00092835.pdf), [EFTA00092837](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00092837.pdf), [EFTA00092839](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00092839.pdf), [EFTA00092845](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00092845.pdf), [EFTA00092847](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00092847.pdf)

#### Additional Redacted Individuals

| EFTA | Date | Notes |
|------|------|-------|
| [EFTA00018874](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00018874.pdf) | Aug 28, 2019 | Advice of Rights. Identity unknown. |
| [EFTA00018955](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00018955.pdf) | Aug 15, 2019 | Advice of Rights. Identity unknown. |
| [EFTA00172165](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00172165.pdf) | Sep 9, 2020 | Target nicknamed **"Benson"**. Demands emails, texts, documents. Period: Aug 2019 to present. |

### Category 3: Law Firm / Attorney Subpoenas

| Target | EFTA | Date |

## 2. Production Scorecard

### Estate Executors: Zero Production

Both Indyke and Kahn subpoenas show all 8 clauses with status UNKNOWN — no returns linked. The 1953 Trust agreement, drafts, notes, and communications remain unproduced.

### MCC Officers: Nominal Compliance at Best

| Individual | Clauses | Fulfilled | Unfulfilled | Unknown | Quality |
|-----------|---------|-----------|-------------|---------|---------|
| Clyde Washington | 17 | 13 | 4 | 0 | LOW confidence only |
| S. Shakir | 16 | 12 | 0 | 4 | LOW confidence only |
| Tova Noel | 19 | 3 | 16 | 0 | LOW confidence only |
| Michael Kearins | 9 | 7 | 2 | 0 | LOW confidence only |
| FORTHWITH [Thomas?] | 10 | 7 | 1 | 0 | LOW confidence only |
| R. Adams | 8 | 1 | 7 | 0 | FALSE MATCH |
| Perry Joyner | 9 | 0 | 0 | 9 | Zero returns |
| Michael Davis | 9 | 0 | 0 | 9 | Zero returns |
| R. Silvia | 16 | 0 | 0 | 16 | Zero returns |
| Samantha DiMisa | 8 | 0 | 0 | 8 | Zero returns |

All "fulfilled" entries carry LOW confidence because the PQG's matching linked them to copies of the subpoenas circulating in internal DOJ emails — not to actual responsive documents produced by the officers.

**No MCC officer produced identifiable responsive documents in the EFTA corpus.**

---

## 3. The Unsubpoenaed

The PQG identified 199 individuals with HIGH-frequency document presence who were never served with a grand jury subpoena.

> **Note:** Grand jury subpoena decisions reflect prosecutorial strategy, available evidence, and resource allocation — not the universe of all persons who appear in the documentary record. The absence of a subpoena does not indicate investigative failure or deliberate omission.

### Staff and Associates

| Individual | Role | Document Count |
|-----------|------|---------------|
| Lesley Groff | Executive assistant | 93,634 |
| Alfredo Rodriguez | Former butler (deceased) | 17,187 |
| Larry Visoski | Chief pilot | 14,114 |
| Carlos Rodriguez | Staff | 13,978 |
| Bella Klein | Staff | 10,009 |

### Associates and Business Figures

| Individual | Document Count |
|-----------|---------------|
| Glenn Dubin | 5,333 |
| Leon Black | 4,817 |
| Jes Staley | 4,703 |
| Woody Allen | 3,613 |
| Noam Chomsky | 3,373 |
| Lawrence Krauss | 3,293 |
| Deepak Chopra | 1,993 |
| Peter Thiel | 1,487 |
| Bill Gates | 1,281 |

### Politicians

| Individual | Document Count |
|-----------|---------------|
| Andrew Stein | 9,723 |
| John de Jongh | 4,147 |
| Larry Summers | 3,980 |
| Ehud Barak | 3,930 |
| Donald Trump | 2,356 |
| Bill Clinton | 1,458 |
| Bill Richardson | 1,253 |

Document counts reflect name presence across the full text corpus (1.38M documents). A high count indicates investigative relevance, not necessarily culpability.

## 4. The Angara Trust

A separate subpoena targeted "the Angara Trust and attendant accounts" ([EFTA01654828](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01654828.pdf)). The rider references UBS statements for "116 E. 65th LLC" and a "Ghislaine Maxwell account" — documenting a transfer of **$14,194,596.49** from the LLC to Maxwell's personal account (April 2016). Zero returns. Gap ID 113, HIGH severity.

---

## 5. Structural Observations

1. **The investigation's individual subpoena strategy was almost entirely focused on MCC officers.** Of approximately 32 individual subpoenas, at least 28 targeted correctional personnel. Only 2 targeted estate figures. None targeted known associates, business partners, or alleged co-conspirators. Prosecutors may have investigated associates through institutional subpoenas for their banking, phone, and email records, through civil litigation discovery, or through cooperating witnesses — channels that would not appear as individual subpoenas.

2. **The estate executor subpoenas are the most significant unfulfilled demand.** The 1953 Trust was the central financial vehicle of Epstein's estate. Its terms, beneficiaries, and structure remain undisclosed despite explicit grand jury demands.

3. **The "Benson" subpoena (September 2020) is chronologically anomalous.** Issued over a year after Epstein's death, demanding emails and texts from August 2019 onward — suggesting a late-identified witness or a parallel investigation thread.

4. **The MCC investigation was broader than publicly known.** The public narrative focused on Noel and Thomas. The subpoena record shows at least 28 additional officers were subpoenaed — including 12+ with fully redacted names and a supervisor (Kearins) questioned about post-death record destruction.

5. **Ghislaine Maxwell appears as a named individual in many institutional subpoenas** — American Express, UBS Financial Services, airlines, Amazon, Interlochen Center for the Arts — but was never directly subpoenaed. She was the subject of a separate indictment.
