- **[EFTA01683907](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01683907.pdf)/10/13** (dataset10) -- **SEPARATE CAIR REVIEW**: MCC prison camera footage review (case 90A-NY-3151227), NOT the Epstein device image review. This is about DVR cameras at MCC for July 5, 2019. Cameras: Front lobby, lobby waiting area, lobby main entrance. Time window: 2pm-10pm. Cross-referenced with case 90C-NY3154599.
- **[EFTA00027069](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00027069.pdf)** (dataset8) -- Scheduling logistics, pushing call to next day

### VERIFIED
1. **The review protocol existed and was executed.** The original email from an AUSA on Oct 19, 2020 initiated a review of image/video files from Epstein's devices using the CAIR (Computer Analysis and Imaging Response) system.
2. **10 specific devices were assigned** across 4 device groups:
   - NY-3027571_Safe: NYC024355
   - NY-3027571_2159: NYC024323, NYC024326, NYC024334
   - NY-3027571_2194: NYC024368, NYC024394, NYC024390, NYC027908, NYC027910
   - NY-3027571_MAC: NYC024363
3. **Deadline was "next Friday" from Oct 21, 2020** (i.e., Oct 30, 2020).
4. **The review was connected to the Maxwell Superseding Indictment** -- the indictment was attached to the protocol email "which contains a photograph of Epstein and Maxwell."
5. **Reviewers used CAIR from their desks** -- the devices had been available in CAIR for "over a year" per [EFTA00037676](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00037676.pdf).
6. **At least partial results WERE documented in the files.** [EFTA00037760](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00037760.pdf) page 0 states: **"Both are done. They are both negative on images and videos."** referring to devices NYC027908 (NY-3027571_219407 WINDOWS) and a Siemens device (NY-3027571_215974 WINDOWS -- image.E01). Response from "Mandy": "Thank you!"

### UNVERIFIED
1. **Results for the other 8 devices are not documented in the released files.** Only 2 of 10 devices have documented outcomes ("negative").
2. ~~**Whether any devices returned POSITIVE results is unknown.**~~ **UPDATE (2026-02-12):** FBI CID summary ([EFTA00038617](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00038617.pdf), approved 7/17/2024) confirms a "small number of CSAM images found on one of Epstein's devices" and "NO bedroom cameras found." CAIR review system documented in [EFTA00037676](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00037676.pdf). Separately, 14 devices yielded "highly confidential responsive material" (nude/semi-nude content, [EFTA00020974](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00020974.pdf)). However, the fundamental gap stands: only 2 of 10 assigned devices have documented review outcomes in the released files, and the Oct 2020 review protocol has no results document.
3. **No final summary or report of the complete review has been found.**

### MISSING
1. **Results for devices**: NYC024363, NYC024394, NYC024326, NYC024368, NYC024390, NYC024334, NYC024323, NYC024355 -- no completion emails found.
2. **The actual review protocol document** (attachment: "2020.10.19_Epstein_devices_responsiveness_review_protocols_image_&_video_files.pdf") is referenced but not present as a standalone EFTA.
3. **Any summary report to supervisors or the case file.**

### NEW FINDINGS
1. **[EFTA00038214](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00038214.pdf) reveals that reviewers were flagging "screenshots of maps" as confidential** because they "related to travel." This means the devices contained travel-related data that was being categorized during review. The instruction to "keep doing that" suggests a pattern of travel-related content on Epstein's devices.
2. **[EFTA01683907](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01683907.pdf)/10/13 reveal a SEPARATE CAIR review** of MCC prison surveillance cameras from July 5, 2019 (the date of Epstein's first apparent suicide attempt/injury). The investigators were looking at "Front lobby, lobby waiting area, and lobby main entrance" cameras from 2pm-10pm. They asked about "visitors center" or "visitors room" cameras -- suggesting interest in who visited Epstein that day. This is case 90A-NY-3151227 (Epstein death investigation), with a related case 90C-NY3154599. The video from DVR1 was downloaded and ready for upload.
3. **The "attention this case is getting from EM"** ([EFTA00037676](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00037676.pdf)) indicates executive management pressure to expedite the device reviews.

## LEAD 2: Austrian Passport / Marius Fortelni Follow-up

### Previous Finding
[EFTA00021576](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00021576.pdf) documents an Austrian passport found in Epstein's safe under the name "Marius Fortelni" with Saudi Arabia residence. An agent was "assigned to call" the Austrian Embassy or Fortelni.

### Documents Actually Read (PDFs)
- **[EFTA00021576](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00021576.pdf)** (dataset8) -- Full email chain, 2 pages, July 15-16, 2019
- **[EFTA00025539](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00025539.pdf)** (dataset8) -- Shorter version of same chain, 1 page
- **[EFTA00021578](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00021578.pdf)** (dataset8) -- **GIA diamond grading reports** found in the safe alongside the passport

### VERIFIED
1. **The Austrian passport WAS found in Epstein's safe** during the July 2019 search of his 9 East 71st Street mansion.
2. **The passport bore the name "Marius Fortelni" with Jeffrey Epstein's photograph** and listed residence as Saudi Arabia.
3. **An AUSA (SDNY) identified the real Marius Fortelni** living in Southampton, NY, via his websites (forteproperties.us, mariusfortelni.com). The AUSA noted Fortelni had resided in Saudi Arabia, matching the passport.
4. **The AUSA explicitly requested** that investigators: (a) determine Fortelni's birthday to compare with the passport date, (b) contact Fortelni to ask why a passport with his name and Epstein's photo was in Epstein's safe. Quote: "try to contact him and ask if he has any reason to know why a passport from his native country with his name on it would have Jeffrey Epstein's photograph on it and be in a safe in Epstein's mansion??"
5. **An NYPD/FBI Child Exploitation Human Trafficking Task Force agent stated on July 15, 2019: "I will give him a call tomorrow."** The agent's cell: [redacted].
6. **Also found in the safe**: 48 diamonds with individual GIA appraisal sheets ([EFTA00021578](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00021578.pdf) contains 48 diamond grading reports), foreign currency, $72,083 cash, $100 AMEX traveler check, a diamond ring, Epstein's expired US passport (for comparison).

### UNVERIFIED
1. **Whether the call to Fortelni was ever actually made.** The agent said "I will give him a call tomorrow" but NO follow-up email documenting the call results exists in the released files.
2. **Whether Fortelni's birthday matched the passport date.**
3. **Whether the Austrian Embassy was ever contacted.**
4. **Whether this passport was ever forensically analyzed** (authenticity, age, origin).

### MISSING
1. **Any document recording the results of the call to Marius Fortelni.** This is the single most glaring gap. The AUSA gave specific instructions, the agent agreed to call -- but no result was ever documented (or if documented, was not released).
2. **Any FBI 302 or interview memo from a Fortelni interview.**
3. **Any Austrian Embassy response or diplomatic communication.**
4. **Any forensic analysis of the passport itself.**

### NEW FINDINGS
1. **The AUSA was an Assistant U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York** (name redacted). The urgency is palpable: "Given the time pressure I think it's totally fine to call him."
2. **[EFTA00025539](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00025539.pdf) is a shorter duplicate** of the same chain -- produced from a different custodian, confirming the email was shared within the team.
3. **The 48 diamond grading reports ([EFTA00021578](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00021578.pdf)) are GIA (Gemological Institute of America) certified** -- documenting individual diamonds by carat, clarity, color, and cut. The diamonds were found alongside the passport in the same safe, indicating this was Epstein's high-value storage.

## LEAD 3: Bannon-Epstein Texts

### Previous Finding
[EFTA00027290](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00027290.pdf) states text messages between Steve Bannon and Jeffrey Epstein were found on Bannon's iPhone 7, marked "not responsive to our warrant."

### Documents Actually Read (PDFs)
- **[EFTA00027290](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00027290.pdf)** (dataset8) -- The original notification email, 1 page, dated April 12, 2021
- **[EFTA00025553](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00025553.pdf)** (dataset8) -- GM (Ghislaine Maxwell) photo found on Bannon's phone, June 11-14, 2021
- **[EFTA00027291](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00027291.pdf)** (dataset8) -- Unrelated (BOP documents without green watermark), adjacent EFTA number only

### VERIFIED
1. **Text messages between Steve Bannon and Jeffrey Epstein existed on Bannon's iPhone 7.** [EFTA00027290](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00027290.pdf) states this explicitly: "Wanted to let you know that there are a number of text messages between Steve Bannon and Jeffrey Epstein on Bannon's iPhone 7."
2. **The texts were deemed "not responsive to our warrant."** The AUSA who found them (whose name is redacted) noted: "They aren't responsive to our warrant."
3. **The AUSA was from SDNY** -- identified as "Assistant United States Attorney, United States Attorney's Office, Southern District of New York."
4. **The phone was being reviewed under a separate case** -- context indicates this was the "WBTW" (We Build The Wall) case, not the Epstein case directly.
5. **[EFTA00025553](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00025553.pdf) reveals a SECOND significant finding on Bannon's phone**: A photograph of Trump and Ghislaine Maxwell was found on Bannon's iPhone 7 during the WBTW responsiveness review. The reviewer "discussed with Sunny" and flagged it to the Epstein/Maxwell team. The response from the senior AUSA: **"Thanks very much for flagging -- no need to do anything with this one, but thanks for letting me know, and do let me know if anything else pops up."**

### UNVERIFIED
1. **Whether a separate warrant was ever sought for the Bannon-Epstein texts.** No document in the released files indicates a supplemental warrant, application, or even a discussion about obtaining one.
2. **The content of the texts between Bannon and Epstein.**
3. **The date range or volume of the texts.**
4. **Whether any other investigative step was taken regarding this finding.**

### MISSING
1. **Any warrant application or discussion about obtaining the Bannon-Epstein texts.** This is a critical gap. Texts between a senior political figure and a sex trafficking defendant were identified, flagged as outside warrant scope, and apparently no further action was taken.
2. **Any memo or discussion about the significance of the Bannon-Epstein communications.**
3. **Any record of the Trump-Maxwell photo being preserved or analyzed beyond the "no need to do anything" instruction.**

### NEW FINDINGS
1. **[EFTA00025553](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00025553.pdf) is a previously under-reported document.** It shows that during the same Bannon phone review, an image of Donald Trump and Ghislaine Maxwell was found. The reviewer flagged it to the AUSA handling both the WBTW and Epstein/Maxwell cases, and was told to disregard it.
2. **The Bannon phone was being reviewed by someone "helping out with the responsiveness review for WBTW"** -- confirming this was the We Build The Wall fraud case.
3. **The person who found the texts ([EFTA00027290](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00027290.pdf)) and the person who found the photo ([EFTA00025553](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00025553.pdf)) appear to be different individuals**, both reviewing Bannon's phone at different times (April 2021 vs June 2021).
4. **No document suggests any cross-case coordination** between the WBTW team and the Epstein team regarding these findings.

## LEAD 4: ESWW SEC Filing / Epstein Financial Trust / Apollo

### Previous Finding
Christopher Dilorio claimed "Epstein Financial Trust Company Inc" appeared as the sole SEC filing in an ESWW (Environmental Solutions Worldwide)/Apollo filing. SEC Litigation Release No. 17673A confirmed a $15M pump-and-dump.

### Documents Actually Read (PDFs)
- **[EFTA00009904](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00009904.pdf)** (dataset8) -- Dilorio email to SEC/DOJ, May 6, 2019, 10 pages
- **[EFTA00010750](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00010750.pdf)** (dataset8) -- Dilorio email chain, May 23, 2019, 17 pages
- **[EFTA00010786](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00010786.pdf)** (dataset8) -- Dilorio email, 27 pages (longest version)
- **[EFTA00029043](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00029043.pdf)** (dataset8) -- Dilorio email, May 23, 2019, 18 pages
- **[EFTA00027528](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00027528.pdf)** (dataset8) -- Another Dilorio email chain (referenced in database)

### VERIFIED
1. **Christopher Dilorio was a real whistleblower** who repeatedly emailed the SEC OIG, SEC Commissioners, DOJ officials, and others. His emails contain extensive detail about alleged financial fraud connections.
2. **Dilorio's core claim**: Environmental Solutions Worldwide Inc (ESWW, OTCMKTS) was a "money laundering shell" connected to Leon Black, Apollo Global Management, and Jeffrey Epstein.
3. **Dilorio cited SEC Litigation Release comp17673.htm** which does confirm a real SEC enforcement action: "This case involves a $15 million 'pump and dump' scheme involving the securities of Environmental Solutions Worldwide, Inc."
4. **Dilorio specifically claimed**: "The ONLY SEC filing of Epstein's Financial Trust Company Inc is in -- wait for it -- Leon Black/Apollo Environmental Solutions Worldwide." He provided an SEC EDGAR link: https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1082278/000090901211000390/0000909012-11-000390-index.htm
5. **Dilorio linked Apollo to Kushner** via the 666 Fifth Avenue Brookfield deal financed by Apollo, and referenced the SEC dropping its Apollo investigation after Josh Harris met with Kushner at the White House.
6. **Dilorio was present in the DOJ files because his emails were forwarded within the SDNY/DOJ system** as potential evidence or tips.

### UNVERIFIED
1. **Whether the ESWW-Epstein Financial Trust SEC filing actually shows what Dilorio claimed.** The SEC EDGAR link he provided would need to be independently checked. Dilorio's emails are voluminous but self-referential; he makes claims and cites URLs but the DOJ files do not contain any investigator's verification of these claims.
2. **Whether DOJ/SDNY ever investigated Dilorio's allegations.** There is no memo, 302, or response in the released files.
3. **Whether the Apollo-Epstein financial relationship was ever pursued through the ESWW angle.**
4. **Dilorio's credibility as a source.** His emails are profanity-laden, rambling, and conspiratorial in tone. He calls SEC officials "grossly corrupt scumbags," claims to be "INFINITELY smarter than anyone on this email list," and threatens prosecution. However, his factual citations (SEC filings, EDGAR links, litigation releases) are verifiable and specific.

### MISSING
1. **Any DOJ/FBI analysis of Dilorio's claims about Epstein Financial Trust's SEC filings.**
2. **Any independent verification of the Epstein Financial Trust / ESWW / Apollo connection.**
3. **Any response from the SEC OIG or enforcement division to Dilorio's repeated complaints.**
4. **The actual ESWW SEC filing listing Epstein Financial Trust** -- it is referenced by URL but not present as a document in the EFTA files.

### NEW FINDINGS
1. **Dilorio claimed he was threatened by an anonymous caller** after filing complaints: "HE (I think a male although very effeminate voice) was an anonymous, coward, scumbag who threatened me. AND then called me another 11/12 times after that." He characterized this as whistleblower intimidation.
2. **The emails were sent to an extraordinarily wide distribution** including SEC OIG, SEC Chair, multiple DOJ offices, FINRA, and specific AUSAs.
3. **Multiple EFTA numbers contain essentially the same Dilorio email chain** ([EFTA00009904](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00009904.pdf), 00010710, 00010724, 00010750, 00010786, 00011051, 00015194, 00019148, 00027528, 00029043) -- at least 10 copies from different custodians, indicating broad distribution within DOJ.
4. **Dilorio also connected Epstein to Stephen Feinberg (Cerberus)** and the BAWAG/Refco scandals, and linked Virtu Financial's acquisition of Knight Capital to the broader money laundering network.

5. **Results of the "Freddy Caraballo Proffer (re Epstein)."**

### NEW FINDINGS
1. **[EFTA00020852](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00020852.pdf) reveals a SECOND witness** being proffered through Crowell & Moring about the same CBP officer. This witness apparently had the CBP officer "listed as a contact in his phone" and was asked about the CBP officer's interactions with Epstein. This indicates the investigation expanded beyond the self-reporting officer.
2. **The CBP officer had previous problematic behavior**: a dispute with a female landlord that went to court over "monetary instruments," and a female acquaintance who "attempted suicide" -- the same person who later filed the DOJ and Sheriff complaints.
3. **The supervisor noted the officer's "previous international travel history" and "personal rendezvous excursions"** as suspicious in light of the Epstein connection.
4. **[EFTA00031980](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00031980.pdf) reveals that CBP travel records for Maxwell and Epstein were incomplete**: "the outbound travel records were not recorded in CBP database during that time (between 1990-2000) as they are today." This means pre-2000 travel by Epstein and Maxwell through USVI was NOT captured in CBP systems, a significant gap for the investigation.
5. **Maxwell had TWO different name variations** in CBP records (with and without a space in her surname), requiring separate TECS queries.

## LEAD 6: Richard Taus Claims

### Previous Finding
FBI Special Agent Richard Taus, incarcerated at Clinton Correctional, wrote to AUSA Audrey Strauss in July 2020 claiming information about Epstein's death and "J. Doe." Processed as Civilian Crime Report.

### VERIFIED
1. **Attorney Anthony V. Lombardino wrote to AUSA Audrey Strauss on July 17, 2020** on behalf of Richard Taus (inmate #91A1040) at Clinton Correctional Facility.
2. **The letter is on Lombardino's law firm letterhead** -- the unredacted version ([EFTA00006036](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%204/EFTA00006036.pdf)) clearly shows "ANTHONY V. LOMBARDINO" with his signature.
3. **The letter states Taus "is a former Special Agent with the FBI and a former decorated Lt. Colonel and helicopter pilot who served our country with honor and distinction during the Vietnam War."**
4. **Taus's specific claims per the letter**: (a) He "believes he possesses important information relative to the death of Jeffrey Epstein"; (b) He has "information regarding Ghislaine Maxwell"; (c) He has "relevant information to an individual named J. Doe who visited him while an inmate in prison."
5. **The letter was processed as a Civilian Crime Report (CCR)** on August 24, 2020. The SDNY office noted: "We sent our usual letter with the form to be completed, but this particular submission does not really fit that so we might not get anything more, but let us know if we do that you want to see it."
6. **The CCR was forwarded to the FBI** per "usual practice of conveying Epstein/Maxwell tips to the FBI." ([EFTA00038275](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00038275.pdf))
7. **[EFTA00038276](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00038276.pdf) is a REDACTED version** of the same letter -- notably, in this version, "Richard Taus" and related identifying information are REDACTED (replaced with blank spaces), while [EFTA00006036](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%204/EFTA00006036.pdf) (from a different dataset) contains the unredacted version.
8. **An attached letter from the prisoner himself** ("07_04_2020_Letter_From_Prisoner_Mentioned_By_Anthony_Lombardino.pdf") was sent with the CCR forwarding but is NOT present as a standalone EFTA document.

### UNVERIFIED
1. **Whether Taus was ever interviewed.** No document in the released files records an interview with Taus, an FBI 302, or any follow-up visit to Clinton Correctional.
2. **What specific information Taus claimed to have** about Epstein's death, Maxwell, or "J. Doe."
3. **Who "J. Doe" was** -- the person who allegedly visited Taus in prison.
4. **Whether the FBI took any action after receiving the CCR forwarding.**

### MISSING
1. **Any FBI 302 or interview memo from a Taus interview.** This is the most significant gap.
2. **The prisoner's own letter** (dated July 4, 2020) -- referenced as an attachment ("07_04_2020_Letter_From_Prisoner_Mentioned_By_Anthony_Lombardino.pdf") in the CCR forwarding but not found as a separate EFTA.
3. **Any response from the FBI to the SDNY forwarding.**
4. **Any investigation into who "J. Doe" was or why they visited Taus in prison.**
5. **Any verification of Taus's claims about Epstein's death.**

### NEW FINDINGS
1. **[EFTA00006036](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%204/EFTA00006036.pdf) (dataset4) contains the UNREDACTED version** of the Lombardino letter -- with Taus's full name, inmate number, and the explicit reference to "J. Doe." The redacted version ([EFTA00038276](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00038276.pdf), dataset8) blanks out "Richard Taus" and identifying details. This differential redaction across datasets is significant and may indicate inconsistent redaction standards.
2. **The CCR system had a "log"** -- the SDNY staff member wrote "[name], please make a note in the log" -- indicating CCRs were tracked in some database or spreadsheet.
3. **The SDNY staff's own assessment was skeptical**: "this particular submission does not really fit that so we might not get anything more" -- suggesting they viewed the submission as unlikely to produce useful leads.
4. **Lombardino identified himself as "a former Assistant United States Attorney"** -- lending the letter more credibility than a typical prisoner tip. Despite this, the processing appears to have been routine.
5. **[EFTA00019647](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00019647.pdf) shows the CCR system received OTHER Epstein-related tips**, including from foreign countries. The office noted: "Because it is from someone in a foreign country, we do not respond." This suggests a pattern of receiving but not acting on tips.

## CROSS-CUTTING OBSERVATIONS

### Patterns of Non-Follow-Up
Across all 6 leads, a consistent pattern emerges: initial documentation exists, but follow-through documentation is systematically absent. **UPDATE (2026-02-12):** Subsequent revisit analysis across the full corpus has confirmed and strengthened this finding. The pattern extends beyond these 6 leads to include: Richardson denials never challenged, Leon Black investigation closed despite 4+ victims, Alexander brothers NTOC tip sat for years without follow-up, and flight log incompleteness never explained.

| Lead | Initial Action Documented | Follow-Up Documented |
|------|--------------------------|---------------------|
| 1. Device Review | Protocol created, teams assigned | Only 2/10 device results (both negative) |
| 2. Austrian Passport | "I will give him a call tomorrow" | No call results documented |
| 3. Bannon Texts | "Not responsive to our warrant" | No supplemental warrant sought |
| 4. ESWW/Dilorio | Emails received, circulated | No investigation documented |
| 5. CBP Officer | Self-incriminated, proffer sessions held | No proffer results or charges documented |
| 6. Taus Claims | CCR processed, forwarded to FBI | No interview documented |

### Three Possible Explanations
1. **Follow-up documents exist but were not released** in these EFTA datasets (withheld under exemptions).
2. **Follow-up documents exist in classified or sealed files** not subject to FOIA/release.
3. **Follow-up was never completed** -- leads were documented but not pursued.

### Document Cross-Dataset Inconsistencies
- [EFTA00006036](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%204/EFTA00006036.pdf) (dataset4) contains the UNREDACTED Taus/Lombardino letter; [EFTA00038276](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00038276.pdf) (dataset8) contains the REDACTED version. This suggests different redaction passes or standards across dataset releases.
- The CAIR review emails appear in both dataset8 and dataset10 with varying levels of redaction.

### Key EFTA Numbers for Further Investigation
- **[EFTA00037760](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00037760.pdf)/37766**: The ONLY documented review results (2 devices negative)
- **[EFTA00038214](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00038214.pdf)**: Travel-related screenshots on Epstein devices
- **[EFTA00025553](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00025553.pdf)**: Trump-Maxwell photo on Bannon's phone
- **[EFTA00031495](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00031495.pdf)**: CBP officer self-incrimination memo
- **[EFTA00020852](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00020852.pdf)**: Second witness proffer about CBP officer
