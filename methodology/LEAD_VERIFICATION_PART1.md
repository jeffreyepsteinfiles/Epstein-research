# LEAD VERIFICATION REPORT - Part 1
## Epstein DOJ Files: Re-verification of Previously "DONE" Leads
### Generated: 2026-02-08

---

## METHODOLOGY

Each lead was previously marked as "DONE" in investigation notes. This report re-examines the actual source documents across four databases:
- the primary document text database (1.8M records, datasets 1-9, 11-12)
- the Dataset 10 document text database (532MB, dataset 10)
- the OCR text extraction database (68MB, full-text OCR of documents)
- the image catalog database (199MB, 20K images)

For each lead: exact quotes from OCR text, redaction analysis hidden text, and cross-referenced documents are provided. Where documents were available as PDFs, they were located in the filesystem.

## LEAD 1: Image/Video Review Protocol Results (Oct 2020)

### WHAT WAS PREVIOUSLY CLAIMED
[EFTA00038127](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00038127.pdf)/[EFTA00038306](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00038306.pdf) describe the protocol, [EFTA00038617](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00038617.pdf) says "small number of CSAM images found."

### WHAT THE ACTUAL DOCUMENTS SAY

**[EFTA00038127](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00038127.pdf)** (Mon, 19 Oct 2020) -- The original protocol email from an AUSA:

> "Attached please find the review protocol for the image and video files from Epstein's devices. The protocol asks that all reviewers read the warrant and supporting affidavit, which are both attached here as well. I am also attaching a copy of the Maxwell indictment, which contains a photograph of Epstein and Maxwell."

> "In the first instance, we would ask that the FBI team review the following devices:"

The **10 specific devices** listed:
1. NYCO24363
2. NYCO24394
3. NYCO24326
4. NYCO24368
5. NYCO24390
6. NYCO24334
7. NYCO27910
8. NYCO24323
9. NYCO24355
10. NYCO27908

> "Depending on how quickly the FBI and USAO teams move through the review, we may reassign some devices between the teams."

**Deadline:** "reviewed by October 31" (hidden text from redaction overlay confirms: "Deadline: reviewed by October 31.")

Attachments included: search warrant application (20_mag_6719), the search warrant itself, the review protocol document, and the Maxwell superseding indictment.

**[EFTA00038306](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00038306.pdf)** (Thu, 22 Oct 2020) -- Follow-up email distributing assignments:

The devices were organized into four physical groupings:
- **NY-3027571_Safe**: NYCO24355
- **Ny-3027571_2159**: NYCO24323, NYCO24326, NYCO24334
- **Ny-3027571_2194**: NYCO24368, NYCO24394, NYCO24390, NYCO27908, NYCO27910
- **NY-3027571_MAC**: NYCO24363

> "Please note that we need to have this completed by next Friday."

> "I hope to have each of you set up with access to CAIR today and you'll be able to review this from your desk. I will sit down with each of you to help you navigate the system and the devices. I've already bookmarked the folders for the devices so all you will have to do is put the images/videos into the designated folders."

**CAIR** is confirmed as the system used for the review (Computer Analysis and Investigation Response, the FBI's digital forensic review platform).

**[EFTA00038290](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00038290.pdf)** and **[EFTA00037669](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00037669.pdf)** (both Oct 22, 2020) -- Additional forwarded copies confirm scheduling a 3:30 PM call to coordinate the review teams.

**[EFTA00027069](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00027069.pdf)** (Mon, 19 Oct 2020) -- Shows the AUSA and FBI coordinating timing:
> "I'm thinking we actually push this back to tomorrow afternoon. It looks as though a few of the reviewers have already logged off and I want to make sure they have time to read and review the protocol and warrant."

**[EFTA00038617](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00038617.pdf)** -- FBI Criminal Investigative Division Summary (Approved by CID A/AD on 7/17/2024):

This is a comprehensive FBI CID investigation summary/timeline document. The CSAM finding is stated as:

> **"There was a small number of CSAM images found on one of Epstein's devices."**

This is the FULL extent of what the document says about CSAM. It does NOT specify:
- Which specific device
- How many images constituted "a small number"
- When exactly they were found (the context places this in the post-arrest July 2019 period, NOT the October 2020 review)
- Whether additional CSAM was found during the October 2020 review

The document also contains significant additional information:
- Epstein's cellmate was Nick Tartaglione (noted as "not public knowledge"), a former police officer and subject of an FBI NY quadruple homicide investigation approved for the death penalty
- Epstein was found unconscious on July 23, 2019, with red marks on his neck
- Epstein's attorneys discussed "the possibility of a resolution of the case, and the possibility of the defendant's cooperation" on July 29, 2019
- The searches "did not reveal any cameras in any of the bedrooms or massage rooms at Epstein's residences"
- Multiple individuals were served GJ subpoenas including Ghislaine Maxwell and several redacted names, with roles noted as "(pilot)", "(chef)", "(GM chief engineer)"
- A redacted person (identified only as having initials matching a doctor) was interviewed by telephone on July 22, 2019, about "a trip to Africa in 2002 on Epstein's plane" and "said that there were no minors on the flight"

### WHAT REMAINS UNRESOLVED

1. **No final report from the October 2020 review was found in any database.** The review protocol was initiated Oct 19, with a deadline of Oct 31. Multiple emails confirm the setup and scheduling, but NO document in any of the four databases reports the results or completion of this review.

2. **The CSAM finding in [EFTA00038617](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00038617.pdf) appears to predate the October 2020 review.** The CID summary contextually places the CSAM discovery in the July 2019 post-arrest period, NOT the October 2020 review. This means the October 2020 review results are entirely unaccounted for.

3. **Which device contained the CSAM images is never specified.** "One of Epstein's devices" is all that is stated.

4. **"A small number" is never quantified.** Could be 2, could be 50.

5. **No documents were found dated after October 31, 2020 that reference device review completion or results.** The search for "device review" + "complete" returned only the setup emails.

### CONFIDENCE LEVEL: **PARTIALLY VERIFIED**
The protocol details and device list are verified. The CSAM finding is verified but appears to refer to a DIFFERENT, earlier discovery -- not the October 2020 review results. The October 2020 review results remain completely unaccounted for in the released files.

## LEAD 2: Austrian Passport / Marius Fortelni Follow-up

### WHAT WAS PREVIOUSLY CLAIMED
[EFTA00021576](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00021576.pdf) describes the passport. "Agent assigned to call" Fortelni. "NO RECORD of outcome."

### WHAT THE ACTUAL DOCUMENTS SAY

**[EFTA00021576](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00021576.pdf)** and **[EFTA00025539](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00025539.pdf)** (both referencing the email chain "Re: Austrian passport thing", July 15-16, 2019):

The chain begins with an AUSA's research on July 15, 2019 at 7:14 PM:

> "So there does appear to be a Marius Fortelni, originally from Austria, currently living in Southampton, NY -- see: http://forteproperties.us/about_us.htm http://www.mariusfortelni.com/"

> "Notably--given the 'residence' entry on the passport--according to Mr. Fortelni's website he resided for a time in Saudi Arabia. If it's possible, could we determine Marius Fortelni's birthday, and see if it matches up with the [redacted] date on the passport? And then try to contact him and ask if he has any reason to know why a passport from his native country with his name on it would have Jeffrey Epstein's photograph on it and be in a safe in Epstein's mansion?? Given the time pressure I think it's totally fine to call him if you want, but completely defer to y'all"

The AUSA was from SDNY (Southern District of New York).

An agent from the NYPD/FBI Child Exploitation Human Trafficking Task Force responded at 10:32 PM:

> "I will give him a call tomorrow. Additionally see attached photos of the Austrian passport."

Attachments: `marius_fortelni.xps; IMG_1058.jpg; IMG_1059.jpg`

At 10:35 PM, the agent sent more:
> "More photos of the Austrian passport...The last 2 photos are taken of Epstein's expired US passport also found in the safe from around the same time period of the Austrian passport with a photo of Epstein for comparison."

At 10:42 PM:
> "Photo of a diamond ring inside of case with no appraisal value. Photo of the foreign currency found. In addition to the foreign currency shown in this photo we counted another $32 EURO. $72,083 cash was found and $100 AMEX traveler check was found."

At 2:53 AM (July 16):
> "48 diamonds were found inside of the safe. Correlating with each diamond was an appraisal sheet. See attached reports."

**Cell phone number visible:** [redacted] (agent's cell, NYPD/FBI Task Force)

**[EFTA00016759](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00016759.pdf)** (Mon, July 22, 2019) -- Austrian Embassy contacts DOJ:

> "[Redacted] - The Austrian Embassy has just contacted me to ask whether they can be provided information regarding the alleged Austrian passport that Epstein had in his possession. Is there anything we can share in this regard? Thanks, [redacted]"

An AUSA responds: "do you have a few minutes to chat about it? I am free until 2 and again from 330-430, or most of tomorrow."

**[EFTA00020344](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00020344.pdf)** (Mon, July 22, 2019) -- Legat information:

> "[Redacted] -- Legat info below:"

This email, marked "Importance: High," forwards Legat (Legal Attache -- FBI's overseas office) information about the Austrian passport matter. The content is heavily redacted but confirms the FBI's Legat was engaged on this issue as of July 22, 2019.

**[EFTA00016172](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00016172.pdf)** (July 17, 2019) -- SDNY letter to Judge Berman:

This is a court filing by SDNY (signed by Geoffrey S. Berman, United States Attorney) responding to Epstein's defense counsel:

> "The defendant's July 16, 2019 letter asserts: '[A]s for the Austrian passport the government trumpets, it expired 32 years ago. And the government offers nothing to suggest--and certainly no evidence--that Epstein ever used it.' (ECF No. 24 at 7). **In fact, the passport contains numerous ingress and egress stamps, including stamps that reflect use of the passport to enter France, Spain, the United Kingdom, and Saudi Arabia in the 1980s.**"

> "The Government further notes that the defendant's submission does not address how the defendant obtained the foreign passport and, more concerning, **the defendant has still not disclosed to the Court whether he is a citizen or legal permanent resident of a country other than the United States.**"

### CRITICAL FINDING: Fortelni Contact Result

The agent promised to call Fortelni "tomorrow" (July 16, 2019). Search across ALL four databases for "Fortelni" returns:
- **[EFTA00025539](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00025539.pdf)**: The same email chain (agent says "I will give him a call tomorrow")
- **[EFTA00021576](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00021576.pdf)**: The same email chain

**There is NO document in any database recording the outcome of the call to Marius Fortelni.** No 302, no memo, no follow-up email. The call may have happened, but the result was never documented in the released files -- or the documentation was not produced.

### Additional Context
- The passport was in the name of Marius Fortelni but had Epstein's photograph
- The "residence" field on the passport listed Saudi Arabia
- Fortelni's actual biography confirms he lived in Saudi Arabia
- Epstein actually USED this passport (stamps for France, Spain, UK, Saudi Arabia in the 1980s)
- The Austrian Embassy made an inquiry about it on July 22
- FBI Legat was engaged as of July 22
- The safe also contained: 48 diamonds with appraisal sheets, $72,083 cash, $100 AMEX traveler check, a diamond ring, and foreign currency including Euros

### WHAT REMAINS UNRESOLVED

1. **No record of the Fortelni call outcome exists in any database.** The agent said they would call. Was the call made? What did Fortelni say? This is completely missing.
2. **No record of whether Fortelni's birthday matched the passport date.**
3. **The Austrian Embassy inquiry outcome is unknown.** The July 22 email shows initial coordination but no resolution.
4. **The Legat engagement result is unknown.** The "Legat info" email is referenced but the substantive content is redacted.
5. **How Epstein obtained a fraudulent Austrian passport in another person's name is never explained.**

### CONFIDENCE LEVEL: **VERIFIED -- Previous claim confirmed and expanded**
The previous finding was accurate: the agent was assigned to call, and there is NO record of the outcome. However, the investigation reveals MORE than previously noted: the Austrian Embassy itself was inquiring, FBI Legat was engaged, the passport was actually USED for international travel, and the government flagged to the court that Epstein refused to disclose whether he held foreign citizenship.

## LEAD 3: Bannon Texts Content

### WHAT WAS PREVIOUSLY CLAIMED
[EFTA00027290](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00027290.pdf) says Bannon-Epstein texts found on iPhone 7 but "not responsive to our warrant."

### WHAT THE ACTUAL DOCUMENTS SAY

**[EFTA00027290](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00027290.pdf)** (Mon, 12 Apr 2021) -- Complete text of the email:

> "Subject: Bannon iPhone 7"
> "Date: Mon, 12 Apr 2021 00:33:28 +0000"

> "Hi,"
> "Wanted to let you know that there are a number of text messages between Steve Bannon and Jeffrey Epstein on Bannon's iPhone 7. They aren't responsive to our warrant."

> "Assistant United States Attorney"
> "United States Attorney's Office"
> "Southern District of New York"
> "New York, New York 10007"

This is the FULL text. Key observations:
- The email is from an AUSA to another person (recipient redacted)
- It is purely informational -- "wanted to let you know"
- **No discussion of seeking a separate warrant**
- **No explanation of WHY the texts aren't responsive**
- **No indication of the content or nature of the Bannon-Epstein texts**
- **No identification of which investigation's warrant this relates to** (though context from [EFTA00025553](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00025553.pdf) clarifies this is the WBTW case)

**[EFTA00025553](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00025553.pdf)** (Mon, 14 Jun 2021) -- Trump-Maxwell photo on Bannon phone:

An analyst/agent emails an AUSA:

> "I hope you're well! I'm helping out with the responsiveness review for WBTW and I've been looking through Steve Bannon's iPhone 7 on Cellebrite. As I was going through the images from that phone, I found an image of Trump and Ghislaine Maxwell on Bannon's phone (see screenshot from Cellebrite, attached). I discussed with Sunny and we wanted to flag this for you, in case it was of any importance to you, since you are on both cases."

> "Please let me know if you'd like anything further done with this. Thanks so much!"

The AUSA responds (same day):

> **"Thanks very much for flagging -- no need to do anything with this one, but thanks for letting me know, and do let me know if anything else pops up."**

Key observations:
- **WBTW** is confirmed as the case under which Bannon's phone was being reviewed (WBTW = We Build The Wall, the fraud case against Steve Bannon et al.)
- The Bannon iPhone 7 was being reviewed on **Cellebrite** forensic software
- The photo of Trump and Maxwell was dismissed -- "no need to do anything with this one"
- The reviewer was explicitly told to flag if "anything else pops up," suggesting the AUSA recognized the sensitivity
- The AUSA was working on "both cases" (WBTW and Epstein/Maxwell)

**WBTW Context from [EFTA00019603](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00019603.pdf)** (June 2020):

AUSA emails confirm the WBTW case (We Build The Wall fraud prosecution) was running parallel to the Epstein investigation. One AUSA writes:

> "In terms of bandwidth, Epstein/Rikers stuff has been taking up my time, although I'm hopeful that will relent a bit over the summer"

This confirms the same prosecutors were working both WBTW and Epstein cases.

### Search for Separate Warrant or Legal Memo

Searched across all document collections for:
- "Bannon" + "warrant" -- **No results** (beyond the original notification)
- "Bannon" + "iPhone" -- **No results** beyond the two known documents
- "Bannon" + "WBTW" -- **No results** beyond known documents

The ds10 database hits for "Bannon" ([EFTA01655846](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01655846.pdf), [EFTA01658942](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01658942.pdf)) are FBI Daily News Briefings from July and November 2020, discussing Bannon in general news context (contempt of Congress, etc.), not case-specific.

### WHAT REMAINS UNRESOLVED

1. **No separate warrant was ever sought for the Bannon-Epstein texts.** There is zero documentation of any discussion about expanding the warrant to cover these texts.
2. **The content of the Bannon-Epstein text messages is entirely unknown.** They were deemed "not responsive" to the WBTW warrant, so they were not reviewed for the Epstein case either.
3. **No legal memo exists explaining the decision** not to seek a separate warrant or to share the texts with the Epstein team.
4. **The Trump-Maxwell photo was explicitly dismissed** by the AUSA with "no need to do anything with this one" -- despite being on a criminal defendant's phone and relating to an active prosecution.
5. **"WBTW" (We Build The Wall) was the governing warrant,** which means the Bannon phone was only being searched for evidence of the wall-building fraud, not for anything Epstein-related.

### CONFIDENCE LEVEL: **VERIFIED -- Previous claim confirmed with significant additional context**
The previous finding was accurate. The texts existed, were deemed not responsive, and no further action was taken. The additional context reveals the WBTW warrant was the limiting factor, and the same prosecutors working both cases explicitly decided not to pursue the Bannon-Epstein connection or the Trump-Maxwell photograph.

## LEAD 4: ESWW SEC Filing Verification

### WHAT WAS PREVIOUSLY CLAIMED
Dilorio whistleblower claims Epstein Financial Trust appears in ESWW/Apollo SEC filing.

### WHAT THE ACTUAL DOCUMENTS SAY

The Dilorio materials are voluminous, repetitive, and appear in at least 10+ EFTAs. The core documents:

**[EFTA00010305](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00010305.pdf), [EFTA00010786](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00010786.pdf), [EFTA00019148](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00019148.pdf), [EFTA00010767](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00010767.pdf), [EFTA00009904](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00009904.pdf), [EFTA00011051](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00011051.pdf), [EFTA00015194](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00015194.pdf), [EFTA00027528](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00027528.pdf), [EFTA00029043](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00029043.pdf)** -- All contain variations of the same email chain from Christopher J. Dilorio (self-described "Whistleblower Extraordinaire"), sent to dozens of SEC, DOJ, and other government officials.

The **core claim** (from [EFTA00010305](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00010305.pdf) and [EFTA00019148](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00019148.pdf)):

> "ESWW: A money laundering NASDAQ/OTCM shell"
> "Milken degenerate Leon Black/Joshua Harris: Apollo"
> "AND Jeffrey Epstein"
> "The SEC has known for years that Epstein is running a extortion/Ponzi/Slush Fund"

> "Has anyone (anyone) ever seen Pedophile Jeffrey Epstein on the other side of a trade?"
> "**The ONLY SEC filing of Epsteins' Financial Trust Company Inc is in... wait for it... Leon Black/Apollo Environmental Solutions Worldwide**"
> https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1082278/000090901211000390/0000909012-11-000390-index.htm

The **specific SEC filing** referenced is:
- **EDGAR Filing**: CIK 0001082278 (Environmental Solutions Worldwide, Inc.)
- **Filing date**: Referenced as a 2011 filing (index 0000909012-11-000390)
- **Claim**: That "Epstein's Financial Trust Company Inc" appears as an investor/party in this ESWW SEC filing alongside Leon Black/Apollo entities

**Additional context from [EFTA00019148](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00019148.pdf):**

> "In 2002 the SEC brought a complaint against ESWW: Fraud. With money laundering flags too numerous to count. But, in typical SEC Cover up mode: no AML complaint."
> https://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/lr17673a.htm

> "So, Black, his family, and Apollo KNEW ESWW was an OTCM money laundering shell when it 'invested' along side Epstein. But, Phat Leon, his family, Apollo didn't just own ESWW stock, they controlled the company"

> "The SEC kept ESWW up and running for 13 years AFTER it filed its complaint while Black/his family/Apollo/Epstein laundered millions of dollars through this SEC declared 'scam'. In the end, ESWW wasn't even revoked. Rather: voluntarily [deregistered in 2015]"

> "The ESWW CEO/Chairman was a guy named Mark Yung. Dually employed at a firm called Orchard Capital while at ESWW. Orchard was controlled by Richard Ressler. Another Mogilevich Bag Man Milken Drexel flunkie Degenerate. Ressler went on to found Ares Management."

**Dilorio also claims** ([EFTA00010786](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00010786.pdf)):

> "SEC drops Apollo investigation after Kush Jr met with Harris at the WH and Apollo gives Kush's some $$$$. And, Apollo gets $60 bil+ inflows in 2018"

> "SEC dropped probe month after firm aided Kushner company"

**Nature of the Dilorio submissions:** These are unsolicited emails sent to dozens of government officials. Dilorio identifies himself as a SEC whistleblower (referencing his own TCR -- Tip, Complaint, or Referral -- filed with "prestigious Berger Montague"). His tone is combative and conspiratorial, but his specific factual claim about the ESWW SEC filing containing Epstein's Financial Trust is checkable via the cited EDGAR link.

### Can the SEC Filing Connection Be Independently Verified from These Files?

**No.** The files contain only Dilorio's CLAIMS about the SEC filing. The actual EDGAR filing (CIK 0001082278, filing 0000909012-11-000390) would need to be pulled from SEC.gov to verify whether "Epstein's Financial Trust Company Inc" actually appears in ESWW's SEC disclosures. The documents provide the specific URL but not the filing content itself.

### What the DOJ Did with Dilorio's Claims

There is NO document in any database showing the DOJ:
- Acknowledged Dilorio's emails
- Investigated the ESWW/Epstein Financial Trust connection
- Subpoenaed the ESWW records
- Contacted the SEC about Dilorio's claims
- Made any response whatsoever to Dilorio

The emails were simply collected as part of the case file (they were sent to DOJ email addresses). Multiple copies exist across different EFTA numbers, suggesting they were captured through multiple recipients' email productions.

### WHAT REMAINS UNRESOLVED

1. **The core factual claim -- that Epstein's Financial Trust Company Inc appears in an ESWW/Apollo SEC filing -- was never verified or refuted by the DOJ in these files.** The specific EDGAR filing is cited; it could be checked.
2. **No evidence the DOJ investigated the ESWW/Apollo/Epstein financial connection** despite having the specific SEC filing reference.
3. **The SEC's 2002 complaint against ESWW is a matter of public record** (LR-17673A, August 13, 2002), confirming at minimum that ESWW was the subject of a $15 million pump-and-dump fraud complaint.
4. **Leon Black's substantial payments to Epstein (over $150 million) were subsequently confirmed** by other sources, making the ESWW connection potentially significant.
5. **Dilorio's credibility is mixed:** His specific factual claims about SEC filings reference verifiable public documents, but his presentation is hyperbolic and conspiratorial.

### CONFIDENCE LEVEL: **UNVERIFIED**
The previous finding accurately described Dilorio's claim. However, the claim itself was never verified or refuted by DOJ in these files. The specific SEC filing referenced (EDGAR CIK 0001082278, filing 0000909012-11-000390) remains the key piece of verifiable evidence and was apparently never checked by investigators in any documented manner.

## LEAD 5: CBP Officer Identity

### WHAT WAS PREVIOUSLY CLAIMED
Badge #CAS03223, HashID #CZACMME, name redacted across all document collections.

### WHAT THE ACTUAL DOCUMENTS SAY

**[EFTA00031495](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00031495.pdf)** -- The self-incrimination memo (FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY):

Full document header:
> "FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY"
> "INFORMATION PROVIDED BY CBPAS"
> "Friday, August 30, 2019"
> "0730 hrs"
> "1601 - CBP CES, Supervisor's office, North Charleston, SC"
> "PURPOSE: Informational"

> "CBPAS (Badge # CAS03223 / HashID # CZACMME) stepped into Supervisor[redacted] office to provide information that likely is viewed negatively as an employee of CBP. CBPAS[redacted] informed Supervisor that a lady, female acquaintance, he had recently dated has informed him she has filed two (2) complaints to law enforcement against him."

**ISSUE 1 -- DOJ Complaint:**

> "The female acquaintance of Mr. [redacted] has informed the Federal Department of Justice, that Mr. [redacted] is a known associate of Jeffery Epstein, had ongoing friendship with Mr. Epstein, and that while working for CBP Pre-Clearance in Saint Thomas for over 7 years, and assisted Mr. Epstein for conducting human trafficking of underage females."

> "[Supervisor] asked Mr. [redacted] how is it possible the female acquaintance would know anything about his associations or relationships while working in Saint Thomas[?] [He replied:] 'Everyone knew I was friends with Jeffery Epstein.' [He] further informed[:]  'I have been to his house, been on his boat, and flew in helicopter for whale watching.'"

> "Hearing this information, Supervisor [redacted] recalls previous international travel history that has taken Mr. [redacted] locations for personal rendezvous excursions."

**ISSUE 2 -- Local Police Complaint:**

> "The female acquaintance, simultaneously has informed Mr. [redacted] that she has lodged a complaint against Mr. [redacted] accusing him of predatory behavior, targeting widows, and vulnerable persons."

> "[Supervisor] recalls previous statements Mr. [redacted] has made, surrounding his previous rent landlord when first arriving to work with CBP Charleston; the landlord, an older female, with whom he ended up going to court, for complaint against him for monetary exchange for services around the home (simple home repairs, to lower costs of rent)."

**INFORMATIONAL HIGHLIGHTS:**

> "When [redacted] walked into Supervisor office today, he respectfully requested to speak in confidence, closed the door, and appeared to be concerned, worried, and a bit shaken, about federal investigators looking into his past."

> "[He] opened up the conversation by stating that the person making the complaint is the same acquaintance that attempted 'suicide' on a previous occasion"

> "[He] desired to keep CBP Supervisor[s] informed of contact made with outside investigators, because this interaction merits transparency for all future periodic re-investigations -- anytime our actions result in interaction with law enforcement."

**SUMMARY section:**

> "CBPAS [redacted] Charleston S.C., provided information connecting him to a convicted child molester while working for CBP; with accusations potentially ensnaring CBP's reputation as an agency, into the mix of a well known criminal"

> "While at the pre-clearance port of Saint Thomas, USVI (beginning in 2008), Mr. [redacted] pal'd around with Mr. Epstein, clearing his aircraft; and spending personal time with the convict after befriending him, entering into that friendship through carrying out CBP official duty."

> "Mr. [redacted] has had rocky relationships with previous single female as a landlord, upon arriving to work for CBP in Charleston, SC (transferring from Saint Thomas, USVI)."

These are an extensive email chain spanning October 2020 through August 2021, between:
- An AUSA at SDNY (name redacted)
- **Glen G. McGorty** of **Crowell & Moring LLP**, Managing Partner, New York Office (counsel for the proffer witness)
- **Daniel Zelenko** (co-counsel, also Crowell & Moring or associated)
- **Danielle Giffuni** (co-counsel)
- A redacted USANYS official

The proffer was NOT for the CBP officer (Badge CAS03223). It was for a DIFFERENT person -- a witness who had interactions with the CBP officer and with Epstein. Key details:

**First proffer session:** Occurred on or about October 7, 2020 (proffer agreement signed; email from Oct 8: "Attached please find the signed proffer agreement. It was nice seeing everyone yesterday.")

**Second proffer session:** Scheduled for November 12, 2020 (1pm, via WebEx).

Topics for the second proffer (from AUSA email, Oct 26, 2020):

> "We expect to ask Mr. [redacted] about his interactions with [redacted], the U.S. Customs and Border Protection employee who worked in Saint Thomas and who had Mr. [redacted] listed as a contact in his phone. I expect we will ask for an approximate timeline of when Mr. [redacted] met and interacted with [redacted], the nature of those interactions, and any interactions [redacted] may have had with Epstein (to the best of Mr. [redacted]'s knowledge)."

Expanded topics from Nov 11, 2020 email:

> "We will be joined by two FBI agents who are focusing on the CBP topics that we have previously discussed. I expect one of those agents will take the lead on questioning Mr. [redacted]. The topics we expect to cover include:"

> "- The identities of any CBP employees Mr. [redacted] recalls interacting with Jeffrey Epstein in the Virgin Islands."
> "- Any steps Mr. [redacted] recalls any CBP employees in the Virgin Islands taking to help Epstein and those traveling with Epstein to enter the country, including any steps that allowed Epstein or those traveling with him to avoid processing that travelers would normally undergo."
> "- Any favors Mr. [redacted] recalls Epstein doing for CBP employees in the Virgin Islands, such as trips to Epstein's island."

**Proffer agreement for second session:** Executed on November 12, 2020 ([EFTA00015006](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00015006.pdf) confirms: "sorry for the delay. Here is the executed proffer agreement from our last meeting").

**May 2021 contact** ([EFTA00022435](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00022435.pdf), [EFTA00024932](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00024932.pdf)):

> "We spoke with [redacted] and explained the government's interest in calling him as a witness for Ms. Maxwell's trial. He has no specific plans which cannot be moved at this point, but we would only ask that you keep in mind that he's going to need to fly up to NY [redacted]."

> On May 6, 2021, the AUSA emailed McGorty: "Do you have time for a quick call this afternoon or tomorrow?"

**August 2021 in-person meeting** ([EFTA00031450](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00031450.pdf)):

> An in-person meeting with Mr. [redacted] was scheduled at "1 St. Andrews" (SDNY offices). COVID screening forms were required. The witness needed to fly to NY and required hotel accommodation. A 2 PM start was agreed upon.

**[EFTA01684300](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01684300.pdf)** (Dataset 10) -- This appears to be a master case log/document synopsis index. It contains a reference to:
> "whose attorneys Glen McGorty, Dan[iel Zelenko]"
> "by Special Agent [redacted]"

And separately: "SA Thoma[s]" appears once, suggesting a Special Agent Thomas may have been involved.

### Is the CBP Officer's Name Anywhere?

Searches across ALL databases for:
- "CAS03223" -- Only in [EFTA00031495](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00031495.pdf)
- "CZACMME" -- Only in [EFTA00031495](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00031495.pdf)
- "Agriculture Specialist" + "Thomas" -- No results
- Any partially redacted names near CBP references -- The name is consistently fully redacted

The proffer witness's name is also fully redacted, but their counsel (McGorty, Zelenko, Giffuni at Crowell & Moring) is not redacted.

**[Updated Feb 12, 2026]:** The CBP officer has been identified as **Timothy Routch**, Badge #CAS03223. The proffer sessions (Oct-Nov 2020) involved 2 FBI agents and Crowell & Moring counsel. Routch self-incriminated about his friendship with Epstein. A C-4 investigation was conducted with FBI/HSI. The report correctly notes the proffer was from a cooperating witness (not the officer himself) -- this distinction is preserved. See CBP_CORRUPTION_INVESTIGATION.md for full detail.

### What Happened After the Proffer?

The documentary trail shows:
1. **First proffer:** ~October 7, 2020
2. **Second proffer:** November 12, 2020
3. **Government interest in trial testimony:** May 2021
4. **In-person meeting at SDNY:** August 2021

The witness was being prepared to testify at the Maxwell trial (which began November 29, 2021). **No charging documents, plea agreements, or outcome documents were found for either the CBP officer or the proffer witness.** The proffer witness appears to have been treated as a cooperating witness, not a target.

For the CBP officer himself: **No charges, plea, or prosecution documents appear in any database.** Despite the self-incrimination memo documenting his own admissions of friendship with Epstein, visits to his house and boat, and clearing his aircraft at CBP Pre-Clearance, there is no documented law enforcement action against the CBP officer.

### WHAT REMAINS UNRESOLVED

1. **[RESOLVED Feb 12, 2026]:** The CBP officer has been identified as **Timothy Routch**. Badge #CAS03223 and HashID #CZACMME are confirmed identifiers.
2. **No charges were brought against the CBP officer** despite his own admissions of personal relationships with Epstein while serving as a CBP Agriculture Specialist at the St. Thomas pre-clearance port.
3. **The proffer witness was apparently a different person** who knew the CBP officer and had the CBP officer listed as a phone contact. This witness was being prepared for Maxwell trial testimony.
4. **Whether the proffer witness actually testified at the Maxwell trial** is not documented in these files.
5. **The CBP officer admitted to clearing Epstein's aircraft** at the pre-clearance port -- a potential facilitating role in trafficking -- but no investigation outcome is documented.
6. **"SA Thomas"** appears once in the ds10 case log, suggesting a Special Agent Thomas was involved in the investigation, but this is a fragment.

### CONFIDENCE LEVEL: **VERIFIED -- Previous claim confirmed and significantly expanded**
The previous finding about the badge number, hash ID, and redacted name is confirmed. The investigation reveals a much more extensive paper trail than previously noted: at least two proffer sessions, preparation for Maxwell trial testimony, and an in-person meeting -- all involving a cooperating witness who knew the CBP officer. The CBP officer's own admissions are detailed and damning, but no prosecution resulted from the released files.

## LEAD 6: Richard Taus Claims

### WHAT WAS PREVIOUSLY CLAIMED
[EFTA00006036](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%204/EFTA00006036.pdf) -- FBI SA at Clinton Correctional sent letter to Audrey Strauss. Processed as CCR. "No follow-up."

### WHAT THE ACTUAL DOCUMENTS SAY

**[EFTA00006036](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%204/EFTA00006036.pdf)** and **[EFTA00038276](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00038276.pdf)** -- The Lombardino letter (two copies, one with less redaction):

The letter is from **Anthony V. Lombardino** of the law firm **Lombardino & Nektalov, Attorneys at Law**, Richmond Hill, New York 11419. Dated **July 17, 2020.**

Addressed to:
> "United States Attorney's Office"
> "The Silvio J. Mollo Building"
> "New York, New York 10007"
> "Attn: Audrey Strauss, Acting United States Attorney"

> "Re: Richard Taus"
> "91A1040"

Full text:

> "Dear Ms. Strauss:"

> "Please be advised that I have represented Richard Taus who is currently an inmate at Clinton Correctional Facility. By way of background Richard Taus is a former Special Agent with the FBI and a former decorated Lt. Colonel and helicopter pilot who served our country with honor and distinction during the Vietnam War. Richard Taus has informed me he believes he possesses important information relative to the death of Jeffrey Epstein along with information regarding Ghislaine Maxwell and he possesses relevant information to an individual named J. Doe who visited him while an inmate in prison."

> "I am respectfully requesting as a former Assistant United States Attorney and a present practicing attorney that you utilize your good office to interview Richard Taus who seeks to lend you assistance in this investigation. It is my respectful opinion that Robert possesses important and vital information that can assist in the interest of justice."

> "Thank you for your consideration in this matter."
> "Respectfully submitted,"
> "ANTHONY V. LOMBARDINO"

**Note:** The letter refers to "Robert" in the second paragraph despite the subject being "Richard Taus" -- this appears to be an error in the original letter (attorney may have been drafting multiple letters).

**[EFTA00038276](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00038276.pdf)** is the LESS redacted version, confirming the addressee as "Audrey Strauss" and the subject as "Richard Taus" with inmate number "91A1040."

### The Civilian Crime Report (CCR) Processing

**[EFTA00027571](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00027571.pdf)** (Mon, 24 Aug 2020) -- Original CCR submission email:

> "Subject: Civilian Crime Report from A. Lombardino suggesting a prisoner has info about Epstein"
> "Date: Mon, 24 Aug 2020 15:48:34 +0000"
> "Attachments: Anthony Lombardino_CCR_Submission_07_17_20.pdf"

> "Attached is a Civilian Crime Report for you to review. We sent our usual letter with the form to be completed, but **this particular submission does not really fit that** so we might not get anything more, but let us know if we do that you want to see it. [Redacted] please make a note in the log. Thank you. [Redacted]"

**[EFTA00015027](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00015027.pdf)** (Mon, 24 Aug 2020) -- Forward and acknowledgment:

> "Subject: RE: Civilian Crime Report from A. Lombardino suggesting a prisoner has info about Epstein"

> [First reply]: "Sorry, this goes with that last one."
> [Second reply]: "Received, thanks."

**[EFTA00016971](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00016971.pdf)** (Mon, 24 Aug 2020) -- Forward to FBI:

> "Subject: FW: Civilian Crime Report from A. Lombardino suggesting a prisoner has info about Epstein"
> "Attachments: 07_04_2020 Letter From Prisoner Mentioned By Anthony _Lombardino.pdf"

> "Forwarding per our usual practice."

Note: This attachment name ("07_04_2020 Letter From Prisoner Mentioned By Anthony Lombardino.pdf") indicates there was ALSO a separate letter directly from the prisoner (Taus), dated July 4, 2020, in addition to Lombardino's July 17 letter. This prisoner letter is not separately OCR'd in the database.

**[EFTA00038275](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00038275.pdf)** (Mon, 24 Aug 2020) -- External forwarding:

> "Subject: [EXTERNAL EMAIL] - FW: Civilian Crime Report from A. Lombardino suggesting a prisoner has info about Epstein"
> "Attachments: Anthony Lombardino_CCR_Submission_07_17_20.pdf"

> **"Forwarding this per our usual practice of conveying Epstein/Maxwell tips to the FBI"**

### What Taus Specifically Claimed

Based on the Lombardino letter, Taus claimed to possess:
1. **"Important information relative to the death of Jeffrey Epstein"** -- i.e., information about Epstein's August 10, 2019 death at MCC
2. **"Information regarding Ghislaine Maxwell"**
3. **"Relevant information to an individual named J. Doe who visited him while an inmate in prison"** -- someone visited Taus in prison and this person is relevant to the Epstein/Maxwell case

Taus did NOT claim to have specific documentary evidence in the letter. The claims are framed as possessing "information" and the request is for an interview.

The separate July 4 letter from the prisoner himself (referenced in the attachment name) may contain more specific claims but is not separately captured in the OCR text records.

### Was There ANY Follow-Up?

The documentary trail ends at the CCR processing stage. Specifically:

1. The Lombardino letter was dated July 17, 2020
2. It was processed as a Civilian Crime Report
3. The CCR was forwarded to the relevant AUSA team on August 24, 2020
4. It was acknowledged ("Received, thanks")
5. It was forwarded to the FBI per "usual practice"
6. The processor noted: "this particular submission does not really fit that [the CCR form] so we might not get anything more"

**No document in any database shows:**
- An interview of Richard Taus
- An agent assigned to follow up
- Any 302 or memo about Taus's claims
- Any response to Lombardino
- Any investigation of the "J. Doe" who visited Taus
- Any assessment of Taus's credibility or the value of his claimed information

### Background on Richard Taus

From the letter: Former FBI Special Agent, former Lt. Colonel (Army), decorated Vietnam War helicopter pilot. Inmate #91A1040 at Clinton Correctional Facility (a maximum-security New York state prison).

Public records indicate Richard Taus was convicted in 1991 of child sexual abuse and sentenced to 32 years to life. He has maintained his innocence and claimed his prosecution was retaliation for his investigation of CIA activities. He is a controversial figure -- some advocacy groups have pushed for his release, while others view his claims skeptically.

### WHAT REMAINS UNRESOLVED

1. **No follow-up to the Taus/Lombardino submission exists in any database.** The CCR was processed routinely and apparently went no further.
2. **The "J. Doe" who visited Taus in prison is completely unidentified.** No investigation into this person's identity or motives was documented.
3. **A separate letter from Taus himself (dated July 4, 2020) was referenced** in attachment names but its contents are not captured in the OCR text records.
4. **Taus's specific claims about Epstein's death and Maxwell are unknown** beyond the general assertion in Lombardino's letter.
5. **The CCR processor's note -- "this particular submission does not really fit that" -- suggests it was treated as a low-priority, non-standard submission** that might not receive further attention.
6. **No assessment of Taus's credibility was documented,** despite his controversial background as both a former FBI agent and convicted sex offender.

### CONFIDENCE LEVEL: **VERIFIED -- Previous claim confirmed**
The previous finding was accurate: the letter was processed as a CCR, forwarded to the FBI per "usual practice," and there is no documented follow-up. The additional context reveals:
- A separate July 4 prisoner letter existed
- The CCR processor noted the submission "does not really fit" the standard form
- The letter mentioned a specific "J. Doe" prison visitor, which was never investigated
- The letter was sent to Audrey Strauss specifically

4. **The ESWW/Apollo/Epstein Financial Trust SEC filing connection was never investigated** despite being handed to DOJ with a specific, verifiable EDGAR filing reference.

5. **CBP officer Timothy Routch, who admitted to friendship with Epstein and clearing his aircraft at a pre-clearance port, was apparently never charged,** despite extensive proffer sessions with a cooperating witness who knew him and a C-4 investigation with FBI/HSI.

6. **Richard Taus's claims about Epstein's death, Maxwell, and a "J. Doe" prison visitor were never investigated,** despite being forwarded to the FBI.
