# COMPLETE REVIEW: Text Extracted From Document Text Layers in Epstein Files

## Overview

This report documents all significant text extracted from document text layers across the Epstein Files Task Force Archive (EFTA). The term "hidden text" used throughout this report refers to text from invisible OCR text layers (Tr=3 rendering mode in PDF), not text concealed beneath removable redaction overlays. As confirmed by the REDACTION_TEXT_LAYER_ANALYSIS report, the black redaction bars in these documents are baked JPEG pixels, not PDF annotation objects. The OCR was performed on original pre-redacted page images, and the resulting text layer was placed over the scanned (redacted) versions. The extracted text IS genuine government content, but the extraction method is OCR text layer reading, not redaction removal. DATA QUALITY NOTE: A data quality audit confirmed ~98% of 'bad_overlay' records are OCR noise from degraded scans. Text searches remain valid for identifying document content. The full_text_corpus.db (PyMuPDF extraction) now provides a cleaner path to the same text layer content. Two source files were systematically reviewed:

- **all_hidden_text_50plus.txt**: 2,205+ entries of hidden text with 50+ characters
- **hidden_text_names_keywords.txt**: 4,703 entries of shorter hidden text (10-49 characters) containing significant keywords

Entries that were OCR garbage, email boilerplate, routine date/time stamps, "CAUTION - EXTERNAL EMAIL" warnings, and content-free FBI email headers were excluded from this report.

### UK Extradition Legal Analysis
**[EFTA00016026](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00016026.pdf) | Pages 2-3**
> "...the consent given to the US authorities would not be binding on the RP in the UK or on the UK court. Consent to extradition must be given irrevocably in writing to the UK court under s72 (8) Extradition Act 2003. In other words what the RP is offering in the US is a promise to consent before the UK court, which [is un]en[forcea]ble..."

> "...the RP had received appropriate legal advice (because it is irrevocable and there is no ground of appeal. The SSHD would then have 2 months to arrange the surrender. The only consent that matters is the one before the extradition judge in the UK and it will usually be determined at the initial hearing but can be offered at any time before the extradition hearing has concluded. There is no caselaw on this to my mind but the relevant statutory provisions are s 72 (7)(b) and 72(8) for full order, s74 (7)(b) and s74 (8) for provisional arrest and s127 and s128 on consent- irrevocable point/legal advice and sending of case to SSHD."

## SUMMARY OF KEY FINDINGS

### Most Significant Revelations

1. **Leon Black Investigation**: The files reveal an extensive, previously undisclosed FBI investigation into Leon Black spanning 2021-2024, involving DANY (Manhattan DA) cooperation, photographs of Black with Epstein, victim allegations of sexual harassment/trafficking/rape, an NDA signed under duress, and a "Spinoff interview from Maxwell" related to Black. The DANY office stated they "do not doubt her allegations against JE and LB."

2. **Harvey Weinstein Massage**: A victim recalled Epstein specifically asking her to massage film producer Harvey Weinstein, suggesting direct sexual facilitation between Epstein and Weinstein.

3. **Victims "Lent Out"**: A victim used the term "lent out" to describe Maxwell or Epstein directing her to have sexual contact with other men, describing a systematic pattern of trafficking.

4. **Ages 13-14**: Multiple victims were recruited at ages 13-14, with one describing Maxwell approaching her at a picnic table the summer she turned 14.

5. **Prince Andrew Interview Request**: Prosecutors formally requested that Prince Andrew agree to be interviewed, with multiple follow-up communications about his "denials about alle[gations]."

6. **$350K in Post-NPA Wire Transfers**: Just days after the Non-Prosecution Agreement, Epstein wired $100,000 and $250,000 from trust accounts to individuals named as possible co-conspirators.

7. **Evidence Destruction**: Multiple witnesses destroyed notes, Maxwell directed disposal of sex toys and photographs, and a victim was forced to sign an NDA under duress.

8. **Prosecution Decisions**: Internal DOJ communications reveal the "no statutory rape" argument, strategy to "cut the press" by filing in District Court, and the eventual finding that "the decision not to prosecute was improper."

9. **Classified FBI Evidence**: Seven discs of consensually monitored phone calls, consent to search documents, and interview records were catalogued under (U//FOUO) markings.

10. **Triggerfish Deployment**: Law enforcement deployed Triggerfish (cell-site simulator/stingray) surveillance technology against Maxwell.

11. **MCC Death Circumstances**: Records show Epstein was reported "in good spirits, nothing unusual" at 7:00 PM the evening before his death, the MCC "accidentally released" a serial bank robber days before Epstein's death, and extensive suicide reconstruction investigations followed.

12. **Abuse with Sex Toys on Minor**: One entry describes the use of "adult sex toys in victim's rect[um]" involving a minor.

# PART II: DATASET 10 — Complete Redaction Analysis

**Added:** 2026-02-05
**Source:** Dataset 10 document text database -- 503,154 PDFs scanned, 545,293 bad overlays with extracted OCR text
**Additional source files:** ds10_hidden_text_50plus.txt (14,216 entries), ds10_hidden_text_keywords.txt (26,970 entries), ds10_all_hidden_text.txt (376,116 entries)

Dataset 10 is by far the largest dataset, containing 30x more documents than all other datasets combined. The redaction scan found **1,629,776 total redactions** with **545,293 bad overlays containing OCR text** -- 7.7x more than all other datasets combined. METHODOLOGY CAVEAT: As documented in the DATA_QUALITY_AUDIT, DS10 bad_overlay results are subject to the same false positive issue as DS9-11 -- garbled OCR of scanned black bars. The 545,293 figure includes a high proportion of noise. The curated 14,216 entries (50+ chars) are more reliable but still contain artifacts.
