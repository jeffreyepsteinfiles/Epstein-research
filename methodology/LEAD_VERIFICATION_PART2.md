# LEAD 7: VICTIM DATABASE / TRACKING SYSTEM ([EFTA00016836](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00016836.pdf))

## WHAT WAS PREVIOUSLY CLAIMED
Epstein "tracked their availability and proximity using the database." A masseuse list was found on seized devices.

## WHAT THE ACTUAL DOCUMENTS SAY

### Source Document: [EFTA00016836](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00016836.pdf)
This document is a **New York Times article by Ali Watkins, dated January 15, 2020**, forwarded internally within DOJ. It reports on a lawsuit filed by the U.S. Virgin Islands Attorney General Denise N. George against Epstein's estate. The article states:

> "Mr. Epstein, a wealthy financier who died by suicide in a Manhattan jail last year, was bringing girls as young as 11 and 12 to his secluded estate in the Virgin Islands, known as Little Saint James, and kept a **computerized database to track the availability and movements of women and girls**, the lawsuit said."

And further:

> "Mr. Epstein used a ring of associates to rotate the women and girls in and out of sexual servitude, using fraudulent modeling visas to transport them across state lines and international borders, the lawsuit said. **He tracked their availability and proximity using the database**, court documents said."

**CRITICAL DISTINCTION**: The "database" claim comes from the USVI Attorney General's **civil lawsuit** against Epstein's estate, NOT from FBI forensic evidence. The article is reporting allegations from this lawsuit, not confirmed forensic findings.

### The Masseuse List: [EFTA00038620](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00038620.pdf)
This is an **FBI internal email** from a Special Agent (FBI Baltimore/Delaware, Violent Crime Safe Streets Task Force), dated February 18, 2025, with subject line "Masseuse List, black book, flight logs." This is a critical document. Exact quote:

> "The attached item titled 'Masseuses' was going to initially be a trial exhibit but **was not used at the Maxwell trial**. It was located on **one of Epstein's digital devices seized from his Manhattan residence**. The names listed are believed to be women and girls, **some of which were identified minors**, who were contacted by Epstein, Maxwell, and his staff to massage Epstein."

> "Separately, the black book was seized by Miami-Palm Beach during the course of their [investigation]. It is an address book that **included identified minors under 'massage'**. Sections of this book were a trial exhibit."

> "The flight logs were kept and provided by Epstein's pilot [...]. This was a trial exhibit."

> "At trial, the black book and the flight logs had **minor victims redacted from the public**."

The attachment was named: `USGME01088970_(masseuse_list).doc`

### The Masseuse Document Itself: [EFTA00024797](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00024797.pdf)
This document has the heading "MASSEUSES" on page 1 (recovered via redaction analysis). However, the actual content is **completely redacted** -- 7 redactions across 7 pages, all classified as `proper_redaction`. The names are NOT recoverable from these databases. The only visible text is the title "MASSEUSES."

### Cross-Referencing Emails About the Masseuse List: [EFTA00021007](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00021007.pdf) / [EFTA00024796](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00024796.pdf)
Internal DOJ emails from November 2020, subject "Epstein victim requests," discuss the masseuse list in the context of identifying victims:

> "Per our call, please find attached the requests from [redacted], including names in footnotes, as well as the **Masseuse list document** that [redacted] was looking at. I'm probably missing something, but **I don't see the names on the list** (with the exception of [redacted] but the last name on the list doesn't match the requester's or is not included)."

This suggests prosecutors were cross-referencing victim claimants against the masseuse list, and many names did NOT appear on it.

### DOJ Database for French Authorities: [EFTA00021720](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00021720.pdf)
A January 2021 email chain about cooperation with French authorities investigating Jean-Luc Brunel states:

> "DOJ executed searches at two Epstein residences (in NYC and the USVI), searched devices, and has **created a significant database of data relating to Epstein**. If French authorities can provide more targeted search terms, DOJ would be willing to review those results to identify records that can be provided to French authorities regarding Brunel."

This confirms the DOJ created an investigative database from seized materials, distinct from any "database" Epstein himself maintained.

### Scheduling System: [EFTA02731082](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2012/EFTA02731082.pdf) (Maxwell Prosecution Memo)
The prosecution memo describes the actual scheduling mechanism:

> "[Redacted] provided [redacted] with training regarding how to make scheduling calls and was [redacted's] direct supervisor. During the year [redacted] worked for Epstein, [redacted] would primarily take responsibility for calling to confirm massage appointments when she was in New York."

### FBI Investigation Summary: [EFTA00038617](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00038617.pdf)
The official FBI timeline confirms:

> "In creating and maintaining a network of minor victims whom he abused, Epstein worked with others, including employees and associates who facilitated his exploitation of minors by, among other things, **contacting victims and scheduling their sexual encounters with Epstein**, both in New York and in Florida."

And a notable detail:

> "contrary to some news reports, **these searches did not reveal any cameras in any of the bedrooms or massage rooms** at Epstein's residences."

## WHAT REMAINS UNRESOLVED
1. **The actual "computerized database" described in the USVI lawsuit has never been publicly identified as a specific forensic artifact.** The claim originates from a civil lawsuit, not FBI forensic reporting.
2. **The masseuse list ([EFTA00024797](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00024797.pdf)) is entirely redacted** -- the names are not recoverable from these databases. We know it existed on a seized digital device, was planned as a trial exhibit, but was ultimately NOT used at the Maxwell trial.
3. **How many victims were on the list is unknown from available data.** The document spans 7 pages.
4. **Whether a formal "database" application existed (vs. a list/document)** is not confirmed by forensic evidence in these records.

## CONFIDENCE LEVEL: PARTIALLY VERIFIED
- The masseuse list EXISTS as a forensic artifact from seized devices -- VERIFIED
- It contained names of women/girls including identified minors -- VERIFIED (per FBI agent)
- It was not used at trial -- VERIFIED
- The "computerized database" for tracking availability comes from a USVI civil lawsuit allegation, not FBI forensic confirmation -- UNVERIFIED as independent forensic finding
- The actual tracking mechanism appears to have been staff making phone calls, not an automated system -- evidence suggests simpler mechanism than "database" implies

# LEAD 8: FLIGHT LOG RETROACTIVE MODIFICATIONS

## WHAT WAS PREVIOUSLY CLAIMED
[EFTA02731168](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2012/EFTA02731168.pdf) p.7: Rodgers confirmed going "back to add in that passenger's name on prior flight logs."

**[CORRECTION STATUS -- Feb 12, 2026]: This lead contains a correction that has been propagated through all subsequent reports. The flight log modification claim was INVERTED in earlier analysis -- the actual document states that Rodgers would NOT go back to add names, explaining incomplete records rather than alleging tampering. This correction is one of the most significant in the investigation.**

## WHAT THE ACTUAL DOCUMENTS SAY

### Source Document: [EFTA02731168](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2012/EFTA02731168.pdf) -- Maxwell Prosecution Memorandum (April 10, 2020)
This is the **SDNY Prosecution Memorandum for United States v. Maxwell**, a 31-page privileged attorney work product. The full context from pages 7-8 is critically important. The key passage:

> "Rodgers kept a log of every flight that he piloted, including for the period between [redacted]. The log reflected the date, departure airport, arrival airport, and technical information regarding the flight. It was also Rodgers's practice to note how many passengers were on board each flight and to **note the names of those passengers he knew. When he did not know the name of a passenger, Rodgers ordinarily would make a generic notation (e.g., 1 female, 1 male, or 1 passenger, etc.).** He explained he was not required to identify his passengers unless crossing an international border, and he was not always introduced to his passengers, so he often flew with passengers whose names he did not know. As a result, **his log does not list flights that Rodgers did not personally fly, and it does not include the names of passengers whose names he did not know at the time of a flight.** When Rodgers learned the name of a passenger who had previously flown on other flights, **Rodgers would use that passenger's name going forward but would not go back to add in that passenger's name on prior flight logs.**"

### CRITICAL INTERPRETATION
The previous finding framed this as sinister "retroactive modifications." The actual context is the **OPPOSITE**:

1. **Rodgers was EXPLAINING that he did NOT retroactively modify logs.** The prosecution memo describes his standard practice: once he learned a name, he used it going forward but **did not go back** to update prior entries.
2. This was being cited by **prosecutors as a limitation of the flight logs** -- explaining why some passengers appeared as anonymous notations ("1 female") rather than by name.
3. The flight logs were **incomplete by design**, not altered. Rodgers only recorded names he knew and only for flights he personally piloted.

### Specific Victim Corroboration from Rodgers
The memo continues with Rodgers specifically corroborating the presence of a victim:

> "Rodgers recalls that in [redacted], Epstein would travel to [redacted]. Rodgers personally visited [redacted] one of those trips and specifically recalls the airport he would fly to for those trips. Rodgers understood that Epstein donated money to [redacted]. Looking back at his flight log, Rodgers confirmed that he flew Epstein to [redacted], and that Maxwell joined Epstein for the return [redacted] shortly thereafter."

> "Rodgers also remembers learning that Epstein and Maxwell met [redacted] during one of those annual trips. Rodgers recalls having been introduced to [redacted] at some point, but he cannot recall the specifics of that introduction, and he only ever interacted with her on Epstein's plane."

### Rodgers' Cooperation: [EFTA00038397](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00038397.pdf)
An internal email from January 7, 2020 confirms Rodgers was cooperative:

> "Just so everyone is in the loop, I got a call from David Rodgers' attorney (in response to our email requesting an interview). **Rodgers wants to be cooperative** and will come in for an interview, but he is currently on a cruise, and his lawyers will need to talk to/meet with him after he gets back. They think late January/early February is a good timeframe to aim for."

### Visoski (Second Pilot): [EFTA00021701](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00021701.pdf)
An internal SDNY email from September 26, 2019 discusses flight records:

> "As a heads up [...], I think the flight records we have **only go back to December 1997** [...]. We don't have any flight records before that date. I'm going to call the lawyer who represents **Larry Visoski** (the pilot) to ask if records from the 90s exist anywhere, but we may be out of luck."

> "The flight records do reflect a 5/3/98 flight from PBI to good old Teterboro, and [...] Maxwell, and Epstein are on the manifest."

Visoski was deeply embedded in Epstein's operations -- he was the registered agent for multiple Epstein aircraft LLCs (JEGE LLC, Plan D LLC, Hyperion Air LLC) and served as manager of several entities. He changed tail numbers on aircraft (N212JE to N1201E in 2017). He handled aircraft purchases and sales even after Epstein's death.

### No Evidence of Tampering Found
Searching across all document collections for "flight log" + "altered/changed/modified/tampered" returns **zero results**. There is no indication anywhere in the DOJ files that flight logs were tampered with. The limitations were inherent to the informal logging system.

## WHAT REMAINS UNRESOLVED
1. The redacted portions of the prosecution memo likely identify the specific victim(s) Rodgers confirmed flying
2. Flight records before December 1997 may not exist
3. Whether Visoski kept separate/different logs is unclear from available records

## CONFIDENCE LEVEL: CONTRADICTED
- The previous finding implied sinister retroactive modifications to flight logs
- **The actual document says the exact opposite**: Rodgers specifically did NOT go back to add names
- This passage was cited by prosecutors to explain LIMITATIONS in the flight logs, not to allege tampering
- The flight logs were incomplete (anonymous passengers, only flights Rodgers piloted) but there is ZERO evidence of deliberate alteration

# LEAD 9: 12 TB OF RAW DEVICE DATA

## WHAT WAS PREVIOUSLY CLAIMED
[EFTA00032104](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00032104.pdf) says "terabytes worth of data... gotten past encryption on multiple devices." [EFTA00037551](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00037551.pdf) describes 60+ devices.

**[Updated Feb 12, 2026]:** Device forensics revisit (#50) confirmed 60+ seized devices, encryption broken, terabytes of data, CART processing dysfunction. FBI CID summary ([EFTA00038617](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00038617.pdf)) confirms CSAM found. "Highly confidential responsive material" (nude/semi-nude images/videos) identified from 14 devices ([EFTA00020974](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00020974.pdf)). 6 machines were still unexported as of October 2020.

## WHAT THE ACTUAL DOCUMENTS SAY

### The CART Report: [EFTA00032104](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00032104.pdf) / [EFTA00009941](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00009941.pdf) / [EFTA00027510](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00027510.pdf)
These documents constitute a **massive email chain spanning February 2020 through August 2020** between SDNY prosecutors and FBI NY CART (Computer Analysis Response Team) personnel. They reveal an extraordinary story of institutional dysfunction in processing Epstein's digital evidence.

**The FBI CART Coordinator's key statement** (May 12, 2020):

> "Sorry it has taken so long, but we are talking about **terabytes worth of data over multiple forms of digital evidence. Phones, tablets, loose media, cameras, DVRs, servers, laptops, and desktop computers.** We have **gotten past encryption on multiple devices.** When we review devices on such large cases, we usually do it piece by piece as things are processed. I was unaware that you didn't want to review as things were processed, that you wanted to do it 'all at once', so that added to the delay."

> "**Relativity is NOT a forensic tool.** It is incapable of dealing with many things that are found forensically on a computer like free space, slack space, and system files to name a few. When we started this, and you insisted you do the taint review in Relativity, I warned you that **it was adding months worth of work on top of what was already done**, and that Relativity was incapable of viewing everything."

### The Scale of Evidence Seized
From [EFTA00009941](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00009941.pdf), the SDNY prosecutor laid out the scope (February 2020):

> "Based on the attached search warrant returns, it looks like from the New York mansion (the PDF) there are **approximately 40 devices** that would have storage (computers, hard drives, thumb drives, etc.) and that's **not even counting at least 60+ CDs**. And then from the Virgin Islands (the Excel spreadsheet), **at least more than 25 devices, including multiple servers / server racks.**"

Total: approximately **65+ digital devices plus 60+ CDs/DVDs**, from two locations.

### The Master Evidence Spreadsheet: [EFTA00037551](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00037551.pdf)
This document provides a **complete inventory** of seized digital evidence. A partial listing of identified devices from the NYC search:

**Phones/Tablets:**
- NYC024318: iPhone (Black in red case, IMEI 357201093322785) -- processed via GreyKey/Physical Analyzer
- NYC024319: iPad Pro 32GB -- processed via GreyKey/Physical Analyzer

- NYC024385: HP desktop
- NYC024387: HP desktop
- NYC024389: Lenovo desktop
- NYC024391: Lenovo desktop
- NYC024393: HP desktop
- NYC027909: Dell desktop

**Laptops:**
- NYC024336-NYC024337: Sony Vaio laptops
- NYC024363: JE Big laptop (MacBook Pro)
- NYC024364: SSD from MacBook Pro
- NYC024367: Toshiba Satellite laptop

**Servers:**
- NYC024373: UNIFI Server
- NYC024376: HP server
- NYC024395: HP Proliant Server (with 7 x 146GB SAS drives in RAID)
- NYC027903: UNIFI Video DVR

**Loose Media:**
- NYC024338: Seagate external drive labeled **"Woody Allen Archive"** -- "Nothing for Southern"
- NYC024339-024347: Multiple thumb drives, SD cards, flash drives
- NYC024348-024350: 3 Seagate IDE hard drives from Florida search
- NYC024351: SD card from Sony Camera
- NYC024354-024355: Iomega external drives
- Large bag containing **approximately 90 CDs/DVDs** -- "Physical review by CART" -- "Nothing for Southern"
- Voice recorders (3): Sony BM-560, Silver Olympus, Black Radio Shack -- "Not processable by CART"

**Notable findings from the spreadsheet:**
- Processing tools used: **FTK** (Forensic Toolkit), **BlackLight** (Mac forensics), **GreyKey** (phone cracking), **Physical Analyzer** (Cellebrite)
- Multiple items marked "Nothing for Southern" (not relevant to SDNY case)
- HP server RAID arrays were **"Attempting to re-build RAID may need to do physical recovery on the drives"**
- One thumb drive was **"Broken Not processed"** (NYC027912)
- 9 IDE hard drives found in Manhattan apartment turned out to be **3 copies of 3 drives from a July 2007 search** on one of his properties
- **A small number of CSAM images were found on one of Epstein's devices** (per [EFTA00038617](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00038617.pdf) FBI timeline)

### The Processing Chaos: [EFTA00009941](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00009941.pdf)
The SDNY prosecution team expressed extreme frustration over months of delays:

> "we've received [the data]... **it's well over a million documents, and we don't have any idea what we're looking at**"

> "The data we've received has **no way to put any emails and attachments together**... Not only is that a big problem for us in review, it's going to be a huge problem for producing the documents to defense counsel."

> "The load file has **no link to the native file**, so when we load the data to the database, there's no way to have the native files show up..."

> "the **control numbers in the load file don't match up to the native files**. So we have two sets of numbers and no way to match up anything"

The FBI CART coordinator explained delays were compounded by:
- Network overhaul: "they mandated we delete old stuff (**about 400 TB worth**)"
- COVID-19 reducing staff to 1 day per week: "reduced us to 1 day a week, so things have been **stretched out by a factor of 5**"
- One Mac item alone had **over 500,000 emails**
- Apple APFS file system complications for newer Mac devices

### The BRG Vendor Proposal: [EFTA00027510](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00027510.pdf)
By July 2020, SDNY had lost confidence in FBI CART and sought a private vendor:

> "they are now well over a month later than their estimate from April... we don't have anything close to an estimate on the USVI materials, which constitute the **overwhelming majority of the data** and are vastly more voluminous than the New York devices."

> "Attached is an estimate we got from **BRG**, which would get everything to us in under a month... in a range of **$85-135K**."

### The 12 TB Drive: [EFTA00027510](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00027510.pdf)
A specific reference to a 12 TB drive:

> "I understand from [redacted] that she was able to provide you with a **12 TB drive** last week -- could you please let us know when we will be able to get the materials?"

### Devices Where Encryption Was NOT Broken
The evidence spreadsheet shows several categories of items that were NOT successfully processed:
- HP server RAID arrays requiring physical recovery
- One broken thumb drive (NYC027912)
- Voice recorders: "Not processable by CART"
- UNIFI Server: "Processed by HQ Nothing for Southern"
- The spreadsheet does NOT explicitly list any device where encryption remained unbroken, suggesting the GreyKey tool successfully decrypted all phones/tablets

## WHAT REMAINS UNRESOLVED
1. **The USVI (island) device inventory is not fully captured in [EFTA00037551](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00037551.pdf)** -- the CART coordinator said he would "get you the Island stuff tomorrow" but that portion appears separate
2. Whether **all RAID arrays were successfully rebuilt** is unclear
3. The full contents of the **500,000+ emails** from one Mac device
4. What was on the **Woody Allen Archive** drive (marked "Nothing for Southern" meaning not relevant to the case)
5. Whether the **BRG vendor was ultimately hired** and what they found
6. The actual total data volume (the "12 TB drive" reference appears to be a storage drive provided FOR copying data onto, not the total data size, though "terabytes" plural is confirmed)

## CONFIDENCE LEVEL: VERIFIED WITH SIGNIFICANT ADDITIONAL DETAIL
- Terabytes of data: VERIFIED -- "terabytes worth of data over multiple forms of digital evidence"
- Encryption broken on multiple devices: VERIFIED -- "gotten past encryption on multiple devices"
- 60+ devices: VERIFIED -- approximately 65+ storage devices plus 60+ CDs from two locations
- Processing was chaotic: VERIFIED extensively -- months of delays, incompatible formats, COVID complications, inter-agency friction
- Relativity platform limitations: VERIFIED -- CART coordinator explicitly warned it couldn't handle forensic artifacts
- CSAM found on at least one device: VERIFIED (per FBI investigation summary)

# LEAD 10: MS. VICKI -- UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE FACILITATOR

## WHAT WAS PREVIOUSLY CLAIMED
Named in victim journal as facilitator in FL and CA. Zero hits beyond journal text.

## WHAT THE ACTUAL DOCUMENTS SAY

### Source Document: [EFTA02731465](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2012/EFTA02731465.pdf) -- Victim Journal
The exact journal entry reads:

> "CONFIDENTIAL FOR ATTORNEY'S EYES ONLY / DO NOT COPY"

> "I will never be able to forgive myself for not being able to tell you **what Ms. Vicki does and what really happens in FL and CA.**"

> "I hope you dont ever meet fat pig Weinstein or the rest"

### Context from Same Journal ([EFTA02731465](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2012/EFTA02731465.pdf))
Other entries in this journal provide broader context about the victim's experience:

- The victim describes being pregnant: "I am now over 20 weeks with a baby we are certain is [Jeffrey's]" and disputes between Epstein and Maxwell about whether to terminate
- References to AOL being used to find victims: "That company does not protect kids! They use it to find us!"
- The victim turned 17 during the period described
- Names multiple abusers: "Allen Douschewitz [Dershowitz]", "Mr. Caruthers", "Mr. Islam", "Mr. Leonsis", "Mr. Rai[nes]", "Mr. Ein[horn?]", "Mr. Jacobson", "Mr. Conway", "Mr. Vradenberg", "Bill", "Mr. Sauerkraut Krauss", "Martin Minsky", "Mr. Novak", "Mr. Staley"
- References to forced procedures causing blood and pain

### Database Search Results for "Vicki"
Searching across ALL four databases:
- **OCR text records**: ZERO hits for "Vicki" (the journal was processed via a different pipeline)
- **v2 redactions**: Two hits:
  - [EFTA01580063](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01580063.pdf): "This Vicki Is read-only" -- appears to be a software/file system message, NOT a person
  - [EFTA02135013](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA02135013.pdf): "Vicki Beltz" -- a name appearing in what looks like a contact/email list alongside many other names (Jay Pirrone, Christine Dolan, Beth Massoud, Robert B. Dean, etc.)
- **ds10 redactions**: Same two hits
- **Image analysis**: Zero relevant hits

### Search for Alternate Spellings
- "Vicky": Only hits are references to journalist **Vicky Ward** (who wrote about Epstein for Vanity Fair) and a podcast "Chasing Ghislaine" by Vicky Ward. NOT the same person.
- "Victoria": Multiple hits for **Victoria's Secret** (lingerie sent to victims), **Lady Victoria Hervey** (British aristocrat who communicates with Maxwell per social media posts), and **Victoria Bruce** (appears in Epstein email chains as a contact). None of these clearly match "Ms. Vicki."

### Assessment of Identity
The journal reference to "Ms. Vicki" suggests:
1. She was a **facilitator** ("what Ms. Vicki does") -- not just a victim
2. She operated in **both Florida and California**
3. The victim was unable or afraid to disclose her activities
4. She is referenced alongside Harvey Weinstein, suggesting she may have facilitated for multiple abusers

**Vicki Beltz** ([EFTA02135013](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA02135013.pdf)) is the only "Vicki" appearing anywhere in Epstein's recovered communications, but there is insufficient context to determine if she is the same person.

**[Updated Feb 12, 2026]:** Subsequent investigation (CBP_RUEMMLER_REMAINING_LEADS, revisit #58) identified Vicki Beltz as a **stone contractor** for Epstein's properties, not a facilitator. The Beltz match is now classified as a false lead. "Ms. Vicki" the female facilitator described in victim journals remains unidentified -- ZERO hits across all databases for the facilitator described in FL and CA.

## WHAT REMAINS UNRESOLVED
1. The identity of "Ms. Vicki" remains **completely unknown** from available database records
2. Her specific role (recruitment, scheduling, transport, or other facilitation) in FL and CA is not described
3. Whether she was investigated or interviewed by law enforcement is unknown
4. The "Vicki Beltz" in the contact list has been **identified as a stone contractor** for Epstein's properties (Feb 12, 2026 update) -- this is a false lead, not the same person
5. The journal entries were marked "CONFIDENTIAL FOR ATTORNEY'S EYES ONLY" -- they appear to have been produced in litigation, not entered as trial exhibits

## CONFIDENCE LEVEL: UNVERIFIED
- Ms. Vicki exists as a named individual in the victim journal -- VERIFIED (as a journal claim)
- She operated as a facilitator in FL and CA -- VERIFIED (as a journal claim only)
- Her identity in the broader evidentiary record -- UNVERIFIED (effectively zero corroboration across 3.4M+ records)
- The "Vicki Beltz" hit has been identified as a stone contractor (false lead per Feb 12, 2026 update)

# LEAD 11: MR. ROBERT AND JILL -- ENTRY POINT INTO MAXWELL'S NETWORK

## WHAT WAS PREVIOUSLY CLAIMED
Named in victim journal as first entry point. Zero additional hits.

## WHAT THE ACTUAL DOCUMENTS SAY

### Source Document: [EFTA02731420](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2012/EFTA02731420.pdf) -- Victim Journal
The exact journal entry reads:

> "CONFIDENTIAL FOR ATTORNEY'S EYES ONLY / DO NOT COPY"

> "Went to a party at this huge house to meet this man named **Mr. Robert and his pretty wife Jill**. **Same exact British lady from Clearwater was there!** She talked to me all night. **She wants me to come to her house in Florida so I can learn new things!**"

> "to get away from Mary?"

### Contextual Analysis
Reading this entry in conjunction with surrounding journal pages from [EFTA02731420](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2012/EFTA02731420.pdf):

1. **The "British lady from Clearwater"** is almost certainly **Ghislaine Maxwell** -- she is the only British woman described throughout these journals as recruiting victims, and she had a Florida presence.

2. The preceding journal entry (same document) describes:
> "That my mom lied about Mr. Glickman all the time. She lied about work trips about Michigan and about Clearwater. Now he is dead and I am being sent to live with her friend. Back and forth? For how long?"

This suggests the victim's mother had a connection to Clearwater, FL, and following "Mr. Glickman's" death, the victim was being sent between homes. The encounter with Maxwell at Robert and Jill's party appears to be the **recruitment moment** -- Maxwell met the victim at a social event hosted by this couple.

3. **"Mary"** is mentioned as someone the victim wanted to get away from -- possibly a guardian or mother's friend she was living with.

4. The phrase "she wants me to come to **her house in Florida**" -- Maxwell inviting the victim to what was likely Epstein's Palm Beach residence, framed as Maxwell's own home.

### Database Search Results
- **"Robert and Jill" (exact phrase)**: ZERO hits across all document collections
- **"Robert" AND "Jill" together in redactions**: ZERO hits
- **"Clearwater"**: ZERO hits in any database
- **"Glickman"**: ZERO hits in any database

### Significance
Robert and Jill appear to have been a **social couple** -- possibly unwitting -- at whose party Maxwell encountered and began grooming this particular victim. The party at their "huge house" provided the social setting for Maxwell's recruitment approach. The journal strongly implies this was the victim's **first contact** with Maxwell's network.

## WHAT REMAINS UNRESOLVED
1. The identity of "Mr. Robert and his pretty wife Jill" is **completely unknown**
2. Whether they were knowing participants in Maxwell's recruitment or merely social acquaintances who hosted a party she attended
3. The location of the party (possibly Clearwater, FL area based on context)
4. The identity of "Mr. Glickman" and "Mary" referenced in adjacent entries
5. Whether law enforcement ever identified or interviewed this couple
6. Zero corroboration across 3.4M+ database records suggests they were either peripheral figures or known by different names in other records

## CONFIDENCE LEVEL: UNVERIFIED
- Robert and Jill exist as named individuals in the victim journal -- VERIFIED (as a journal claim)
- They hosted a party where Maxwell recruited a victim -- VERIFIED (as a journal claim only)
- Their identity or any corroboration in other evidence -- UNVERIFIED (zero hits across all document collections)
- The "British lady from Clearwater" is very likely Maxwell based on context -- PARTIALLY VERIFIED (consistent with known facts but not explicitly stated)

# LEAD 12: THE GREGORYS -- UNNAMED COUPLE

## WHAT WAS PREVIOUSLY CLAIMED
Named in victim journal as an unnamed couple. Unknown identity.

## WHAT THE ACTUAL DOCUMENTS SAY

### Source Document: [EFTA02731420](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2012/EFTA02731420.pdf) -- Victim Journal
The exact journal entry reads:

> "CONFIDENTIAL FOR ATTORNEY'S EYES ONLY / DO NOT COPY"

> "They are always flights of horror."

> "Whether its with Jeffrey, Mr. Leonsis, Mr. Case, Mr. Snyder, **the Gregorys**, Mr. Colgan or one being borrowed by a seemingly 'good' federal worker and even rented,"

> "it is all horror. And nothing is as it seems"

> "I am so confused by everything and people you expect to be good like even old senators like **George Mitchell** who you think would be good like a grandpa are bad."

> "**Mr. Kimsey** is deranged, The answer is c. crazy!"

### Contextual Analysis
"The Gregorys" are named in a list of people associated with **flights** on Epstein's aircraft. The journal describes ALL of these flights as "flights of horror." The other individuals named in the same passage are:

1. **Mr. Leonsis** -- Ted Leonsis, billionaire owner of the Washington Capitals/Wizards (also named in [EFTA02731465](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2012/EFTA02731465.pdf) in connection with a painful "procedure" and video)
2. **Mr. Case** -- likely Steve Case, co-founder of AOL (consistent with the journal's other reference to AOL being used to "find us")
3. **Mr. Snyder** -- Dan Snyder, then-owner of the Washington Redskins (explicitly called "a pig! A red skin hoggett" in another journal entry from [EFTA02731420](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2012/EFTA02731420.pdf))
4. **Mr. Colgan** -- referenced again elsewhere: "Why did Mr. Colgan agree to this!"
5. **George Mitchell** -- former U.S. Senator
6. **Mr. Kimsey** -- Jim Kimsey, co-founder of AOL (died 2016)

All of these are **Washington, D.C. area power figures**, suggesting the Gregorys are likely a D.C.-connected couple.

The journal also mentions the plane being "borrowed by a seemingly 'good' federal worker and even rented" -- implying the aircraft was lent to or used by government employees.

### Database Search for "Gregory"
Searching all databases returned the following categories:

**Gregory Riches** (most frequent "Gregory" in Epstein files):
- [EFTA02077147](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA02077147.pdf) through [EFTA02092891](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA02092891.pdf): Over 20 documents referencing "Gregory Riches"
- Context ([EFTA00362505](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00362505.pdf)/[EFTA00362476](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00362476.pdf)): Gregory Riches was an **interior designer** being considered for work at Epstein's properties. An email from September 2014 discusses him: "I spoke to Gregory Riches for Jeffery regarding his interest in the interior designer role. He is very interested in the role from a permanent standpoint."
- This is an **employee/contractor**, not a power couple associated with flights.

**Gregory Ezring** ([EFTA01923614](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01923614.pdf), [EFTA01923942](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01923942.pdf)):
- Referenced in emails with subject line "For Jeffrey: supporting organization" -- appears to be a professional/organizational contact.

**Gregory W. Harper** ([EFTA01992464](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01992464.pdf)):
- Single reference, insufficient context.

**Gregory P. Wilson** ([EFTA01786113](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01786113.pdf)):
- Single reference in what appears to be a contact list.

**"Sam Gregory"** ([EFTA00013372](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00013372.pdf)):
- Email address sam@samgregory.com appearing in a contact list.

### Assessment
None of the "Gregory" results in the database correspond to a **couple** ("the Gregorys") who would have been traveling on Epstein's flights alongside DC power figures. The journal reference uses "the Gregorys" as a surname for a couple -- similar to how one might say "the Smiths." This is distinct from a first name "Gregory."

## WHAT REMAINS UNRESOLVED
1. The identity of "the Gregorys" remains **completely unknown** from these databases
2. The Gregory surname does not appear in flight logs, passenger manifests, or other travel-related records in these databases
3. Given the context (named alongside Leonsis, Case, Snyder, Mitchell, Kimsey), they are likely a **prominent D.C.-area couple**
4. Gregory Riches (the interior designer) is almost certainly NOT the same person -- he was hired in 2014 as a contractor, not described as a flight companion
5. No couple with the surname Gregory has been publicly linked to Epstein's circle
6. The journal entries appear to be from a single victim whose identity is redacted but who had extensive, years-long exposure to Epstein's operation

## CONFIDENCE LEVEL: UNVERIFIED
- "The Gregorys" exist as named individuals in the victim journal -- VERIFIED (as a journal claim)
- They were associated with flights on Epstein's aircraft -- VERIFIED (as a journal claim only)
- Their identity -- UNVERIFIED (zero meaningful matches across 3.4M+ records)
- The DC power circle context is consistent with other verifiable names in the same passage -- PARTIALLY VERIFIED (Leonsis, Case, Snyder, Mitchell, Kimsey are all real DC-area power figures)

# CROSS-CUTTING FINDINGS

## The Victim Journal ([EFTA02731420](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2012/EFTA02731420.pdf) / [EFTA02731465](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2012/EFTA02731465.pdf))
These two documents are **among the most significant sources** in these leads. They appear to be pages from a handwritten journal by an Epstein victim, produced under attorney-client privilege markings ("CONFIDENTIAL FOR ATTORNEY'S EYES ONLY / DO NOT COPY"). Key observations:

1. **The victim was a minor during the period described** -- she turned 17 during the events, references being in school, and describes being sent to live with others after a guardian figure died.

2. **The victim names dozens of individuals** as abusers or participants, including:
   - Jeffrey Epstein, Ghislaine Maxwell
   - Leon Black (described biting her, causing blood on Jeffrey's carpet)
   - Larry Summers, Prince Andrew, "the old president" (likely Bill Clinton)
   - Dan Snyder, Ted Leonsis, Jim Kimsey, Steve Case, George Mitchell
   - Alan Dershowitz ("Douschewitz"), Jes Staley
   - Martin Minsky, Mr. Novak, Mr. Krauss
   - Harvey Weinstein (referenced as someone she hopes the reader never meets)
   - "Mr. Dana" (with a plane, described as "fucking disgusting" alongside Larry Summers)
   - Mr. Jacobson, Mr. Conway, Mr. Vradenberg, Mr. Caruthers, Mr. Islam
   - Mr. Mody, Mr. Robert, Mr. Sant, Mr. Ludwig, Mr. Cecchi, Mr. Mora, Mr. Goodlatte, Mr. Atkins
   - Ms. Vicki (facilitator in FL and CA)

3. **The victim describes forced pregnancies and procedures**: "I am now over 20 weeks with a baby we are certain is [Jeffrey's]" and multiple references to painful "procedures" with blood.

4. **The journal was produced in litigation** but its evidentiary status (whether it was authenticated, when it was created, etc.) is not determinable from these records.

5. **ZERO corroboration exists in the databases for many of the named individuals** in the specific context described. The names that DO appear elsewhere (Leon Black, Larry Summers, etc.) appear in news articles or investigative references, not as direct forensic evidence of the specific acts described.

## The Flight Log System
The prosecution memo ([EFTA02731168](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2012/EFTA02731168.pdf)) establishes that Epstein's flight logs were:
- Maintained by pilot David Rodgers as a personal log
- Incomplete by design (anonymous passengers, only flights Rodgers piloted)
- NOT retroactively modified (contrary to the previous finding's implication)
- Supplemented by commercial flight records where available
- Missing entirely for flights before December 1997

## Evidence Processing Failures
The CART correspondence reveals that between Epstein's July 2019 arrest and at least August 2020 (over a year), the prosecution team was **unable to fully access or review the seized digital evidence** due to:
- FBI CART understaffing and processing delays
- Incompatible file formats between forensic tools and legal review platforms
- COVID-19 reducing FBI staff to 1 day/week
- Network infrastructure overhauls at FBI
- Fundamental disagreements about processing methodology

This means the Maxwell prosecution (indictment June 2020, trial November 2021) was conducted while the prosecution team was still struggling to access the complete digital evidence from Epstein's residences.
