# The French Connection: Jeffrey Epstein's Operations in France

## A Guide to EFTA Corpus Evidence for French Investigators

*Based on analysis of 2,731,838 pages across 12 DOJ datasets (EFTA), FBI Vault materials, and House Oversight productions.*

---

## Executive Summary

The EFTA corpus — the largest single release of Jeffrey Epstein documents, produced by the DOJ under a federal court order — contains extensive evidence of Epstein's operations in France spanning at least 2005 through 2019. This report consolidates that evidence into a single reference organized around six investigative threads:

1. **The Modeling Pipeline** — Jean-Luc Brunel, MC2 Model Management, Karin Models, and Daniel Siad operated a multinational recruitment network that funneled young women to Epstein through Paris, using visa dependency and financial control as coercion mechanisms.

2. **22 Avenue Foch** — Epstein's Paris apartment, held through SCI JEP (999/1,000 shares), served as an operational base. A September 2019 French police search recovered photographs of undressed young women, 30 videos, and a CD-ROM with 62 women's names.

3. **Jack Lang and Prytanee LLC** — Former French Culture Minister Jack Lang and his daughter Caroline maintained a relationship with Epstein from at least 2012 through January 2019. This included a joint $5.2M art investment vehicle (Prytanee LLC) registered in the US Virgin Islands, private flights to Marrakech, and Caroline Lang arranging a meeting between Epstein and Dominique Strauss-Kahn.

4. **Fabrice Aidan** — A UN diplomat who brokered meetings between Epstein and Gulf-state royalty, intervened in visa processes for unnamed individuals, and directed unnamed "guests" to Epstein's Paris and New York properties.

5. **Frederic Chaslin** — A French orchestra conductor who offered Epstein a 21-year-old philosophy student in Paris, defended Harvey Weinstein while referencing his own "similar situation in Santa Fe," and visited Epstein's Zorro Ranch.

6. **Financial Infrastructure** — Deutsche Bank wired Epstein's funds through Societe Generale and BNP Paribas to support French operations, including property maintenance, luxury purchases, and local payments.

All findings below are drawn directly from the EFTA corpus with specific document citations. Every EFTA number can be verified at [justice.gov/epstein](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/) or at [epstein-data.com](https://epstein-data.com/).

## 1. The Modeling Pipeline

### 1.1 Jean-Luc Brunel and MC2 Model Management

Jean-Luc Brunel ran MC2 Model Management from Miami. His role in Epstein's network is established by multiple corpus documents:

**Brunel as recruiter — in his own words:**
- **EFTA00017956**: Stan Pottinger (attorney) forwarded to SDNY prosecutors: *"Yesterday I spoke of Daniel Siad, whom Jean Luc Brunel describes as a 'scout' or recruiter of girls and/or women for J. Epstein."* Brunel himself identified Siad as recruiting *for Epstein*, not for MC2. This was forwarded to prosecutors on December 6, 2018 — seven months before Epstein's final arrest.
- **EFTA00023920**: *"Jeffrey Epstein has told me that he has slept with over 1,000 of Brunel's girls."*
- **EFTA00021334**: Witness prep memo: *"we expect she'll eventually tell us that she was 18 years old when she arrived in the U.S. through Brunel's modeling agency, and that she met Epstein shortly thereafter at a party and he invited her to his houses, and she quickly became dependent."*

**The MC2 visa dependency mechanism:**
- **EFTA00906771** (Mar 18, 2011): A model named Svetlana wrote to Epstein: *"I m very worried about mc2 visa situation. Does it mean that I can't travel now? I m afraid to ask them if they cancelled my visa — not to remind them to do it..."* Models' immigration status was controlled through MC2, creating a dependency that made resistance dangerous.
- **EFTA00926192** (Dec 20, 2011): Svetlana complained about unpaid agency income — *"The accountant send me only 2nd invoice and 'didn't have time' to send the 2nd part of my first check (he owes me 3,500)"* — visa dependency compounded by financial dependency.

**Financial flows:**
- **EFTA00105307**: Grand jury exhibit documenting payments from Epstein's account 35266976: $25,000 to MC2 (Dec 4, 2013), $29,440 to MC2 (Dec 10, 2013), $25,000 to MC2 (Jan 21, 2014). Same exhibit documents $1.5M+ in payments to 301/66 Owners Corp (the building where Epstein housed models).
- **EFTA01266359**: Epstein's will: *"$5,000,000 to JEAN LUC BRUNEL, if he survives me."*
- **EFTA01266380**: Later amendment also forgives *"any loans which I made to... JEAN LUC BRUNEL"* — Brunel owed Epstein money.

**Operational security:**
- **EFTA01746878** (Jan 26, 2015): Brunel to Epstein: *"I don't want to speak over the phone or email."*
- **EFTA00073492**: FBI FD-302 (Jul 8, 2019) — agents contacted MC2's Miami office. Manager Jeff Fuller asked *"is this about EPSTEIN"* and reported Brunel was *"out of the country in Paris."*

### 1.2 Karin Models and the French MLAT Request

The French investigation is documented directly in the EFTA corpus:

**EFTA00077200-77206** — The French Republic's Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty request to the United States, dated July 8, 2020. This document reveals:

- Investigation initiated August 23/30, 2019 by the Paris Minors' Section
- Charges: rape of minor under 15, rape of minor over 15, rape, sexual assault, criminal association
- Targets: Jeffrey Epstein, Jean-Luc Brunel, Ghislaine Maxwell, and accomplices
- Triggered by report from *"Innocence en danger"* children's association

The MLAT request summarizes five victim testimonies from the French investigation:

1. **Victim 1** met Karin Models (Avenue Roche, Paris 8th) for "test-photographs." Brunel sexually assaulted her at his home in the Bourse district. She *"felt she had been drugged"* — couldn't explain how she found herself in a room with Brunel. Another unidentified man was present.

2. **Victim 2** met Epstein and Maxwell at age 16 in the south of France near Saint-Tropez. Went to their Paris apartment on Avenue Foch in 2000. Left for Miami with them.

3. **Victim 3** met Brunel through Karin Models. At his apartment, she drank a cocktail Brunel prepared, then lost consciousness. Woke in a bathrobe with bruises on thighs and crotch.

4. **Victim 4** met Brunel through Paris Planning agency and Karin Models. Was taken to the countryside to an undetermined location where Brunel attempted rape.

5. **Victim 5** accused Maxwell, Epstein, and Brunel of recruiting her at age 16.

### 1.3 Daniel Siad — International Recruiter

Daniel Amar Siad (Swedish passport holder) is the most extensively documented recruiter in the EFTA corpus, with **1,968 distinct EFTA pages** spanning 2005-2017, covering at least 15 countries.

**Explicit admission of recruiting minors:**
- **EFTA00642502** (Jul 19-20, 2014): After Epstein canceled a Paris visit, Siad reported on the group he had assembled: *"I had 2 girls from Sweden, a Slovakian, 2 French and Katya the Russian."* He then wrote: *"I really did good work for scouting in Scandinavia most of them will be ready to start with 2morrow at list 5 of them sixteen and seventeen will be ready for next year."* And: *"The French her name is Luna she is fifteen her parents checked me out and they are very happy there daughter to start modeling."*
- Epstein responded: *"you will have the money monday"* and *"I will reimburse you of course for any expenses."*

**The Scandinavia scouting tour (May-June 2014):**
- **EFTA00663055**: After managing the departure of a Latvian woman ("Leanne"/"Liana"), Epstein told Siad: *"spend some the the 10k and go to scandavia I will provide more on your return."* Siad then outlined a systematic itinerary: Finland (3 days), Stockholm (5 days), Gothenburg (5 days), Oslo (3 days), Malmo (3 days), Denmark (5 days).

**Scouting language:**
- **EFTA00775255** (Jun 2, 2009): *"I just found an amizinng One she is 20 years old but she looks younger from Latvia."*
- **EFTA00633927** (Jun 20, 2014): *"the ones who never modeled before are my favorite."*
- **EFTA00642502**: *"In This busyness I feel like fisherman some time I cache quick, some time no fish."*

**Countries documented:** Sweden, Latvia, Lithuania, Finland, Norway, Denmark, France, Cuba, South Africa, Bulgaria, Australia, Spain (Barcelona), UAE (Dubai), Thailand, Brazil (Sao Paulo).

**Financial flows to Siad:**
- Western Union: EUR 1,000 via Bella Klein (EFTA00716763, Apr 28, 2011)
- $10,000 cash for Scandinavia scouting (EFTA00663055, May 2014)

- Relocation funding for Barcelona apartment (EFTA00679056, Apr 2017)

### 1.4 Elite Model Look — The Competition Pipeline

The EFTA corpus reveals Epstein had scouts at international modeling competitions:

- **EFTA00638152** (Oct 27, 2011): A Russian-speaking contact at Elite Model Look France emailed Epstein: *"i am on Elite Model look France now ;)) so many cute girls."* Sent with attached photo.
- **EFTA00922621**: Epstein's one-word reply: **"Produce."**

This was not isolated:
- **EFTA00677191** (May 17, 2011): Epstein was pitched a $2.5M investment in "Moda.Ru," a Russian model database with *"10,000 models... Average age of all the girls 18-24."* The pitcher had organized *"Elite Model Look Russia 2007."*
- **EFTA00159321**: FBI proffer establishing that Epstein and Paolo Zempoli tried to **buy Elite Models**. Same document records Epstein looking through model portfolios during casting auditions.

## 3. Jack Lang, Caroline Lang, and Prytanee LLC

### 3.1 The Relationship

Jack Lang (former Minister of Culture under Mitterrand, later president of Institut du Monde Arabe) and his daughter Caroline Lang (Chairman of Sotheby's Switzerland, Impressionist/Modern/Contemporary Art) maintained a relationship with Epstein from at least 2012 through January 2019.

**Jack Lang appears on virtually every Epstein "To See in Paris" list:**
- Feb 2014 (EFTA00284910): *"PARIS To See: Jack Lang, Caroline Lang, Olivier, Jagbland, Davina, Jean Luc..."*
- Jan 2019 (EFTA00285747): *"Reminder: shall we contact Kifah, Pinto, Jack Lang, Raafat, Terje..."* — months before Epstein's July 2019 arrest
- Nov 2012, Mar 2013, Apr 2013, Feb 2014, Mar 2015, Jun 2016, Aug 2016, Jul 2018 — all documented with specific EFTA numbers

**Direct correspondence examples:**
- **EFTA00646607** (Dec 2012): Jack Lang to Epstein: *"Dear Jeffrey, tank you for yesterday and your generous and delicate invitation... I have two tickets [to West Side Story]. Would you like to come with me?"*
- **EFTA00648559** (Jul 2017): Epstein to Jack Lang: *"re trump. as i said they will first go after his family."* Lang: *"You were spot on, Jeffrey!"*
- **EFTA00637637** (Jan 4, 2016): Epstein to both Langs: *"happy new year... hopfully will be in paris mid to late month. to discuss our great project."* — "great project" = Prytanee LLC formation.

**EFTA00398778** (Dec 2012): Richard Kahn (Epstein's financial manager) to Caroline Lang: *"I am sending another 50,000 Euro as per Jeffrey's instructions."* Darren Indyke pressed for Caroline to provide her attorney's contact for a formal agreement.

Caroline Lang responded: *"These funds were sent to ADCM (association des cultures du monde). ADCM is a non-profit organization. The funds were not sent to my father's account. Therefore, there is no need to write a formal agreement between my father and Jeffrey."*

The word *"another"* indicates prior transfers. Indyke was sufficiently concerned to generate repeated calendar reminders (EFTA00394587): *"when he goes to Paris he needs to meet with Lang about the email I got from Caroline Lang stating that no formal agreement was required."*

### 3.3 Prytanee LLC — The Joint Investment Vehicle

The entity was internally referred to as **"the jacques project"** before formal incorporation — **EFTA00325458** (May 16, 2016): Epstein to Binant: *"etiene caroline suggested i contact you directly to see if you have any time to discuss the jacques project."*

### 3.4 The DSK Meeting

**EFTA02103354** (Jun 18, 2014): Caroline Lang arranged a meeting between Epstein and **Dominique Strauss-Kahn**: *"Jeffrey, You have a meeting with him the 30th of June at The Royal Monceau Hotel at 7.30 pm. I will tell you more when you are in Paris."* Subject line: "DSK."

### 3.7 Steve Bannon iMessage Exchange

And great friend. it was Jacques idea to build the pyramid in front of the Louvre... His budget was a multiple of the defense budget."* Bannon: *"Yes he is a legend."*

## 4. Fabrice Aidan — UN Diplomat and Facilitator

**Role:** "Diplomat at United Nations" (LinkedIn, EFTA01961738), "International Advisor" at International Peace Institute (IPI). Co-editor with Terje Rod-Larsen of an Oxford University Press publication (HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_023133).

**Corpus footprint:** 275 distinct EFTA pages, spanning January 2011 through November 2014+.

### 4.1 Visa Intervention

Epstein then forwarded the thread to Terje Rod-Larsen to escalate. Rod-Larsen responded (EFTA01763914): *"Because this is what normally is required! And then it takes at least two weeks. She should have gone there a week ago when everything was ok."*

A UN diplomat and the president of a UN-affiliated think tank were both actively engaged in resolving a visa issue for an unnamed woman connected to Epstein.

### 4.2 Diplomatic Meetings Brokered by Aidan

**EFTA01779758** (Jan 11, 2011): Epstein emailed Aidan the personal cell phone number of HE Mohammed Al Gergawi (UAE Minister of State): *"please call him to set up u.n. meeting dubai."* Aidan: *"Just spoke to him. He will work on it."*

**EFTA00902884** (Jan 26, 2011): Aidan arranged a Davos dinner with HH Sheikh Abdullah Bin Zayed (UAE Foreign Minister). Aidan's contact at the UAE embassy confirmed: *"I was informed by Mr. Fabrice Aidan that HH is invited for dinner tomorrow night."* Boris Nikolic (Bill Gates's science advisor) was involved but ultimately canceled (EFTA01797875).

### 4.3 Directing "Guests" to Epstein Properties

**EFTA01884879 / EFTA01884968** (May 1, 2012): Aidan to Epstein: *"When convenient, can you pls email me your address for me to give to the guest of 19 May."* Epstein: *"in paris it is 22 avenue foch, apt 2 dd/ In new york it is 9 east 71st."*

### 4.4 Rod-Larsen at Avenue Foch

**EFTA01844300** (Jan 6, 2012): Rod-Larsen's IPI assistant CC'd Aidan on flight details to Paris. Epstein confirmed Valdson (his Paris driver) would pick Rod-Larsen up from the airport — establishing that Rod-Larsen stayed at 22 Avenue Foch.

### 4.5 Rothschild Social Circle

**EFTA01933360** (Feb 12-13, 2014): Email thread between Epstein and Ariane de Rothschild (Edmond de Rothschild banking group): *"We're supposed to have dinner with Terje and Fabrice Aidan at L'Ami Louis at 9:00."*

**EFTA00663432** (Sep 26-28, 2013): Olivier Colom (Compagnie Financiere Edmond de Rothschild) told Epstein: *"I'm hiring Fabrice by the way."* This suggests Aidan was transitioning from the UN/IPI to the Edmond de Rothschild orbit, with Epstein as a common node.

## 5. Frederic Chaslin — Procurement and Social Access

**Role:** French orchestra conductor and composer. Conducted at Santa Fe Opera, Israeli Opera (Tel Aviv), and Chatelet Theatre (Paris). Owned 140-foot boat in France.

**Corpus footprint:** 581 distinct EFTA pages, spanning 2009-2017.

### 5.1 "I Found a Great Girl" — Procurement Chain

**EFTA01959040** (Sep 12, 2013, 7:45 PM): Chaslin to Epstein, subject "Paris":
> *"I found a great girl for your next stay in Paris / Student in philosophy / 21 / Looks a little like roman Polanski's current wife (Seigner)"*

**EFTA01959404** (8:32 PM): Epstein: *"Great sept 27"*

**EFTA01959768** (8:41 PM): Chaslin: *"For how long? Should she contact you or one of your assistant may be contact her?"*

**EFTA01959880** (8:42 PM): Chaslin: *"I forgot. Of course perfectly fluent French English Spanish. Her name: Frederica Amelia Finkelstein."*

**EFTA01960181** (Sep 13, 10:35 AM): Epstein to Lesley Groff: *"her name is frederika, friend of paula and fred chaslin, in paris, contact her and set up a skype date."*

**EFTA00383531**: Finkelstein declined, citing another job offer.

This is a complete procurement sequence: identification of a 21-year-old by physical appearance, name and language skills provided, Epstein directs his assistant to "set up a skype date" — matching the well-documented Epstein screening pattern.

### 5.2 Harvey Weinstein Defense and "Similar Situation"

**EFTA02580104** (Oct 18, 2017): Chaslin wrote to Epstein: *"While the world is getting crazy at chasing men (I had a similar situation in Santa Fe, I feel for my fellow male species...)"*

Epstein responded: *"harvey has 50 women who say they just escaped his grasp. you and I know that the only reason he would use the same routine over and over was that in the majority it worked. no one admitting their role."*

Chaslin: *"That is an excellent point!!!!"*

Chaslin's reference to a "similar situation in Santa Fe" — where he conducted at the Santa Fe Opera and visited Epstein's Zorro Ranch — is not further elaborated in the corpus.

### 5.3 Zorro Ranch Visit

**EFTA01873343** (Aug 13, 2012): After visiting Epstein's New Mexico ranch, Chaslin wrote: *"I want to thank you for opening your fabulous ranch to me yesterday... There is something totally voluptuous about all what I saw, I was feeling drunk from the beginning to the end."*

**EFTA01875347** (Aug 11, 2012): In the same email thread arranging the ranch visit, Epstein asked Paula Heil Fisher: *"do you have a good place to go for waxing for the girls."*

### 5.4 Dinners with Woody Allen and Ehud Barak

**EFTA01898876** (Apr 5, 2013): After an evening at Epstein's New York townhouse: *"As a French I of course enjoyed meeting Woody Allen who is a god in Paris as you know."*

The same evening's schedule (EFTA01899917) shows Chaslin's visit timed alongside a dinner with Ehud Barak, Peter Mandelson, Jes Staley, and Mort Zuckerman.

**EFTA01944344** (Dec 28, 2013): Chaslin asked Epstein to forward a concert invitation to Ehud Barak: *"It's at the New Israeli Opera, just next door to where Ehud Barak lives."*
