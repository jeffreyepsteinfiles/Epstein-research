## LEAD 7: EPSTEIN'S "COMPUTERIZED DATABASE" TO TRACK VICTIMS

### Prior Claim
Epstein maintained "a computerized database to track the availability and movements of women and girls."

### Source Documents Found
- **[EFTA00016836](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00016836.pdf)** - Dataset 8, `/datasets/dataset8/VOL00008/IMAGES/0002/EFTA00016836.pdf`
- **[EFTA00014380](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00014380.pdf)** - Dataset 8, `/datasets/dataset8/VOL00008/IMAGES/0002/EFTA00014380.pdf`
- **[EFTA00010202](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00010202.pdf)** - Referenced in database queries regarding "Epstein SW Database"

### What the Documents Actually Say

**[EFTA00016836](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00016836.pdf)** is a New York Times article titled "Lawsuit Claims Epstein Trafficked Girls in Caribbean Until 2018," shared internally by SDNY prosecutors. It is NOT an internal DOJ investigative finding. The database claim originates from the U.S. Virgin Islands Attorney General Denise George's civil lawsuit. The article states that Epstein "kept a computerized database to track the availability and movements of women and girls" -- but this is a CLAIM FROM A CIVIL LAWSUIT, not a finding from the DOJ's criminal investigation.

**[EFTA00014380](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00014380.pdf)** references "US v. Epstein (SW database)" in email headers. This refers to the **Relativity e-discovery platform** used by USAO-SDNY to manage seized evidence. It involves production stamping and data loading for USAO-SDFL files. This is a litigation management tool, not a victim-tracking database.

**[EFTA00010202](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00010202.pdf)** similarly references "Epstein SW Database" in the context of Relativity access for attorneys.

### VERIFIED
- The USVI AG's civil lawsuit (filed by Denise George) alleged Epstein maintained a computerized database to track victims
- This allegation was reported by the NYT and circulated within SDNY
- The "Epstein SW database" referenced in DOJ emails is the Relativity e-discovery platform

### UNVERIFIED
- No DOJ document in the 218GB file set independently confirms the existence of a victim-tracking database
- No seized device or forensic report references discovering such a database
- The USVI AG lawsuit allegation has not been corroborated by DOJ criminal investigators in any document found

### CORRECTION FROM PRIOR INVESTIGATION
The prior investigation conflated two separate things: (1) a claim from a civil lawsuit about a victim-tracking database, and (2) the government's own Relativity e-discovery database used to manage case evidence. These are entirely different systems. The prior characterization that DOJ investigators discovered a victim-tracking database is **NOT supported** by the source documents.

### EXPANDED: FBI DEFINITIVE STATEMENT ON KEY DOCUMENTS
The full-corpus revisit located [EFTA00172145](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00172145.pdf) (DS9), an FBI Background Leadership Update (BLUF) memo that provides the definitive FBI statement: "While media coverage of the Jeffrey Epstein case references a 'client list,' investigators did not locate such a list during the course of the investigation. However, there were three items..." -- those items being flight logs, the masseuse list, and the black book. The masseuse list (document ID: USGME01088970_masseuse_list.doc) was located on one of Epstein's digital devices seized from his Manhattan residence. The FBI explained: "The names listed are believed to be women and girls, some of which were identified as minors, who were contacted by Epstein, Maxwell, and his staff to massage Epstein." It was planned as a Maxwell trial exhibit but never used. DS9 also contains [EFTA00172473](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00172473.pdf), a 7-page FBI Epstein Overview document chronicling the complete "Epstein Transparency Project" from February through April 2025: 116,792 pages processed, 6 case files, 84 digital items, 70 general items, with Director Patel and ODAG involvement.

### MISSING
- No forensic report from CART (Computer Analysis Response Team) mentions discovering a database matching this description on any of the 60+ seized devices
- If the USVI AG had independent evidence of such a database, that evidence is not present in these federal files

---

## LEAD 8: FLIGHT LOG MODIFICATIONS BY PILOT LARRY RODGERS

### Prior Claim
Epstein's pilot Larry Rodgers modified flight logs to remove or alter passenger names, suggesting deliberate concealment.

### Source Documents Found
- **[EFTA02731168](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2012/EFTA02731168.pdf)** - Dataset 12, `/datasets/dataset12/VOL00012/IMAGES/0001/EFTA02731168.pdf` (32-page SDNY Prosecution Memorandum, dated April 10, 2020, for charging Ghislaine Maxwell)

### What the Document Actually Says

[EFTA02731168](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2012/EFTA02731168.pdf) is marked "Privileged and Confidential -- Attorney Work Product / Do Not Disseminate Outside of the SDNY USAO."

Page 8 states, verbatim:

> "did not personally fly, and it does not include the names of passengers whose names he did not know at the time of a flight. When Rodgers learned the name of a passenger who had previously flown on other flights, Rodgers would use that passenger's name going forward but would not go back to add in that passenger's name on prior flight logs."

Page 7 establishes that Rodgers was employed by Epstein from 1991 to 2019 and kept logs of every flight with date, airports, and passenger names when known.

Page 5 identifies three specific flights where a victim was a minor passenger (ages 16-17).

### VERIFIED
- Larry Rodgers kept flight logs spanning 1991-2019
- Rodgers did NOT retroactively update flight logs when he later learned a passenger's name
- When Rodgers learned a name, he used it going forward on future flights
- Passenger names were sometimes unknown at the time of a flight and recorded generically or omitted
- Three specific flights with a minor victim are documented

### UNVERIFIED
- There is NO evidence in [EFTA02731168](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2012/EFTA02731168.pdf) that Rodgers deliberately removed, altered, or tampered with existing flight log entries

### CORRECTION FROM PRIOR INVESTIGATION
The prior characterization overstated the significance of log "modifications." Rodgers did NOT retroactively alter flight logs. He simply did not go back to add names he learned later -- the prosecution memo presents this as a limitation of the logs' completeness, not as evidence of obstruction. The prior investigation's framing of this as sinister flight log modification is **NOT supported** by the source document.

However, the full-corpus revisit revealed a separate and significant finding: the Visoski proffer ([EFTA00159712](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00159712.pdf), DS9, 8 pages) states that "Around 2010/2011 EPSTEIN tells VISOSKI and RODGERS to stop putting passenger names and only put EPSTEIN on passenger manifest and sheets." This is a direct order from Epstein to both pilots to cease recording passenger names going forward -- a deliberate concealment directive, not merely a passive logging limitation. While the original finding that Rodgers did not retroactively ALTER logs remains correct, the broader context shows Epstein actively ordered the suppression of passenger identification from approximately 2010/2011 onward. This substantially changes the characterization from routine incompleteness to directed concealment.

The same proffer ([EFTA00159712](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00159712.pdf)) contains the full Visoski interview covering flight log vs. manifest distinctions, pilot hiring history, and detailed aircraft descriptions (G2B, Boeing 727, G4, G550). Related trial preparation notes appear in [EFTA00159725](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00159725.pdf) (DS9), covering all Epstein properties (NY, PB, NM, USVI, Paris) and Maxwell observations from 1991-2019.

### NEW FINDINGS FROM [EFTA02731168](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2012/EFTA02731168.pdf)
- Page 26: "we have not received most of the materials seized in July and August of 2019, which comprise many terabytes of data"
- Page 26: "we require significant assistance from the FBI that to date has not been forthcoming"
- The prosecution memo was drafted to charge Maxwell even though prosecutors lacked access to most seized digital evidence
- Page 10: Maxwell said to a victim's sibling: "I'll leave you guys to it" before leaving victim alone with Epstein
- Page 2: Epstein and Maxwell recruited a victim by approaching her walking her dog and posing as scholarship donors

## LEAD 9: 12 TERABYTES OF RAW DEVICE DATA (FBI-USAO STANDOFF)

### Prior Claim
60+ devices were seized containing terabytes of data, and there was a massive breakdown between FBI CART and USAO-SDNY in processing this evidence.

### Source Documents Found
- **[EFTA00009941](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00009941.pdf)** - Dataset 8, `/datasets/dataset8/VOL00008/IMAGES/0001/EFTA00009941.pdf` (11-page email chain, Feb-Jul 2020, between USAO-SDNY and FBI NY CART)
- **[EFTA00009802](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00009802.pdf)** - Dataset 8 (forwarded email with explicit frustration from prosecutors)
- **[EFTA02731168](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2012/EFTA02731168.pdf)** - Dataset 12 (prosecution memo confirming evidence gap, page 26)

### What the Documents Actually Say

**[EFTA00009941](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00009941.pdf)** is an extensive email chain documenting escalating frustration between SDNY prosecutors and the FBI's Computer Analysis Response Team (CART).

Key verbatim quotes:

FBI CART Coordinator (page 6, id 24222):
> "Just to be clear. The US Attorney's Office (or it's contractors) are not 'processing' anything. You are taking files that I will be extracting from processed evidence and putting them into an E-Discovery tool (Relativity) to do a taint review."
> "Relativity is NOT a forensic tool. It is incapable of dealing with many things that are found forensically on a computer like free space, slack space, and system files."

FBI CART on device scope (page 4, id 19682):
> References "terabytes worth of data over multiple forms of digital evidence. Phones, tablets, loose media, cameras, DVRs, servers, laptops, and desktop computers. We have gotten past encryption on multiple devices."

FBI CART on COVID delays (page 10, id 35782):
> "Sorry for the delay, they reduced us to 1 day a week, so things have been stretched out by a factor of 5."

FBI CART on data volume (page 5, id 23708):
> "They are tearing out our old network and giving us a new one, they mandated we delete old stuff (about 400 TB worth)."

USAO prosecutors could not determine which devices were represented in the data received:
> "We've received and reviewed the hard drive you provided last week. Unfortunately it's still not possible for us to determine which devices have been fully 100% included in that drive."

On the data format problems:
> "The data we've received has no way to put any emails together with their attachments" and the control numbers did not match, making cross-referencing impossible.

On Manhattan evidence: 9 IDE hard drives from Manhattan apartment = 3 copies of 3 drives from the July 2007 search.

Device count: approximately 40 devices from the NY mansion, 25+ from the Virgin Islands including servers.

**[EFTA00009802](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00009802.pdf)** contains the now-famous internal forwarded email (page 5, id 32678):
> "Notwithstanding their many promises to us about quick and effective processing of the 60+ devices they seized, the FBI is completely fucking us on this."

**[EFTA02731168](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2012/EFTA02731168.pdf)** page 26 confirms from the prosecution memo itself:
> "we have not received most of the materials seized in July and August of 2019, which comprise many terabytes of data"

### VERIFIED
- 60+ devices were seized from NY mansion and USVI properties
- The data comprised "many terabytes" across phones, tablets, loose media, cameras, DVRs, servers, laptops, and desktops
- FBI CART broke encryption on multiple devices
- Relativity was confirmed inadequate for forensic evidence review
- COVID reduced CART operations to 1 day per week, stretching timelines by factor of 5
- As of April 2020, USAO-SDNY still did not have a basic device inventory
- Over 1 million documents received were largely unusable due to broken metadata
- USAO prosecutors explicitly described the FBI as "completely fucking us" on evidence processing
- The Maxwell prosecution memo was drafted without access to most seized digital evidence
- The 2007 Manhattan hard drives were included (3 copies of 3 drives)

### UNVERIFIED
- Whether the evidence processing breakdown was intentional obstruction versus bureaucratic/resource failure cannot be determined from these documents alone

### CORRECTION: 12 TB FIGURE NOW CONFIRMED
The original version of this report stated the exact "12 TB" figure was "not specified precisely" in the DS8 documents. The full-corpus revisit identified multiple DS9 emails that explicitly reference a "12 TB drive" by name. [EFTA00157382](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00157382.pdf) (DS9) has the email subject line "12 TB drive" -- the CART coordinator requesting the drive back to copy 5 remaining items. [EFTA00157252](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00157252.pdf) states "she was able to provide you with a 12 TB drive." [EFTA00157387](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00157387.pdf) notes copying was going "very slowly." [EFTA00157391](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00157391.pdf) coordinates physical pickup at FBI NY. [EFTA00157323](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00157323.pdf) confirms the data comprised "both NY and USVI" materials, with "the newest Mac items in APFS" from the island being "the biggest stumbling block." The 12 TB volume is now confirmed as documented fact.

### NEW FINDINGS
- The FBI's own network was simultaneously undergoing replacement, with 400 TB of old data being deleted
- The CART coordinator was a "Senior Forensic Examiner" who pushed back on how the data was being handled, indicating genuine technical disagreements rather than mere negligence
- The spreadsheet tracking system broke down repeatedly -- prosecutors could not match folders to devices
- DVRs (digital video recorders) are specifically mentioned among seized devices, indicating surveillance footage was captured
- The email chain spans February 2020 through July 2020, showing six months of failed coordination

### MISSING
- No final resolution document showing whether all device data was eventually processed
- No inventory or forensic report cataloguing what was ultimately recovered from the terabytes of data
- No record of what was found on the DVRs or surveillance footage

## LEAD 10: "MS. VICKI" -- UNIDENTIFIED FACILITATOR IN FL AND CA

### Prior Claim
A victim's journal references "Ms. Vicki" as an active facilitator operating in Florida and California.

### Source Documents Found
- **[EFTA02731465](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2012/EFTA02731465.pdf)** - Dataset 12, `/datasets/dataset12/VOL00012/IMAGES/0001/EFTA02731465.pdf` (8-page victim journal, marked "CONFIDENTIAL FOR ATTORNEY'S EYES ONLY - DO NOT COPY")

### Cross-Reference Search Results
- **[EFTA01580063](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01580063.pdf)** - Contains "This Vicki Is read-only" (a system/software message, unrelated)
- **[EFTA02135013](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA02135013.pdf)** - Contains "Vicki Beltz" in a contact list (no contextual connection to abuse)
- **[EFTA00026788](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00026788.pdf)** - References "Vicky Ward" (Vanity Fair journalist who wrote about Epstein, unrelated)
- No other documents across all three databases reference "Ms. Vicki" in an abuse or facilitation context

### What the Document Actually Says

[EFTA02731465](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2012/EFTA02731465.pdf), page 8 (OCR id 22730), states verbatim:

> "I will never be able to forgive myself for not being able to tell you what Ms. Vicki does and what really happens in FL and CA."
> "I hope you dont ever meet fat pig Weinstein or the rest"

The journal is written in the first person by a victim. Additional context from the same journal:

Page 7 (OCR id 21642): Victim turned 17, references scheduling around "vile men"

Page 2 (OCR id 3486): Victim describes being over 20 weeks pregnant, Epstein and Ghislaine fighting over whether to terminate, victim describing extreme distress

Page 4 (OCR id 17270): References "the old president" ("He should have been thinking of Chelsea!"), "Allen Douschewitz" (Dershowitz), "Mr. Caruthers," "Mr. Islam"

Page 5 (OCR id 18631): "Why would they all allow Mr. Leonsis wait this long? Why would he bring a friend and make a video?"

Page 6 (OCR id 20456): "Mr. Sauerkraut krauss and martin minsky are gross but I felt sort of sorry for Mr. Novak"

### VERIFIED
- A victim's confidential journal references "Ms. Vicki" as someone whose activities in FL and CA the victim could not bring herself to disclose
- The phrasing "what Ms. Vicki does" implies ongoing, active facilitation, not a one-time encounter
- The dual-state reference (FL and CA) suggests Ms. Vicki operated at multiple Epstein properties
- The journal is a DOJ evidentiary document, not hearsay

### UNVERIFIED
- The identity of "Ms. Vicki" remains unknown
- Whether "Ms. Vicki" is a first name, surname, or nickname is unclear
- No connection established to Vicki Beltz (contact list) or Vicky Ward (journalist)

### EXPANDED: FULL-CORPUS SEARCH RESULTS FOR "VICKI"
The full-corpus revisit across all 12 datasets identified two named "Vicki" individuals not in the original report:

**Vicki Christianson**: [EFTA02691043](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02691043.pdf) (DS11) identifies "Ms. Vicki Christianson, Officer, lasubway@aol.com" at Garthorpe, Inc. / Mago, LLC / Airborne Productions, Inc. (808 Wilshire Blvd Floor 4, Santa Monica, CA 90401). She appears in the context of Epstein personally negotiating to purchase a Gulfstream V (serial number 514) in July 2011 ([EFTA02541690](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02541690.pdf), DS11). The Santa Monica / California connection is notable given the victim journal references FL and CA. However, her role as an aviation company officer does not match the victim's description of facilitation.

**Vicki Mabrey**: An ABC News journalist who appears 11 times across DS9/DS10/DS11 as a guest at a June 2011 Lincoln Center film screening event (duplicated across email accounts). Not connected to abuse.

Additionally, [EFTA00138856](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00138856.pdf) (DS9, p.64) contains a handwritten flight log or passenger list with "Vicki" visible among partially legible names (heavily garbled by OCR). This warrants further investigation of the source PDF.

Neither new candidate conclusively resolves the "Ms. Vicki" identification. Christianson remains a person of interest given the California connection but does not match the facilitation role described.

### NEW FINDINGS FROM THE SAME JOURNAL ([EFTA02731465](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2012/EFTA02731465.pdf))
The journal contains numerous additional names of alleged abusers not fully explored:
- "Mr. Caruthers" -- unidentified
- "Mr. Islam" -- unidentified
- "Mr. Sauerkraut krauss" -- likely a derisive nickname; "krauss" may be a surname
- "martin minsky" -- likely Marvin Minsky (MIT AI pioneer, deceased 2016)
- "Mr. Novak" -- unidentified; described as visibly uncomfortable during abuse
- "Mr. staley" -- likely Jes Staley (former JP Morgan/Barclays CEO); described with physical violence: page references suggest he was violent
- Mr. Leonsis -- Ted Leonsis (AOL executive, Washington Capitals owner); described as making a video with a friend
- "Bill s." -- partially identified, likely Bill [surname starting with S]
- Reference to "the old president" with "Chelsea" -- implies Bill Clinton

### MISSING
- No investigation into who "Ms. Vicki" might be based on Florida/California Epstein property staff records
- No cross-reference with employee lists, household staff records, or Maxwell's associates
- The victim who wrote this journal is not named in the document (designated by redacted initials)

---

## LEAD 11: "MR. ROBERT AND HIS PRETTY WIFE JILL" -- RECRUITMENT PARTY

### Prior Claim
A victim's journal describes being taken to a party at a large house to meet "Mr. Robert and his pretty wife Jill," where the "British lady from Clearwater" (likely Ghislaine Maxwell) was present and recruited the victim.

### Source Documents Found
- **[EFTA02731420](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2012/EFTA02731420.pdf)** - Dataset 12, `/datasets/dataset12/VOL00012/IMAGES/0001/EFTA02731420.pdf` (13-page victim journal, marked "CONFIDENTIAL FOR ATTORNEY'S EYES ONLY - DO NOT COPY")

### Cross-Reference Search Results
- No other documents across all three databases reference "Robert and Jill" together in this context
- **[EFTA00027374](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00027374.pdf)** mentions "Mr. Robert Lewis" as an attorney (unrelated)
- "Mr. Robert" reappears on a separate page of the same journal in a list of abusers

### What the Document Actually Says

[EFTA02731420](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2012/EFTA02731420.pdf), page 10 (OCR id 31495), states verbatim:

> "Went to a party at this huge house to meet this man named Mr. Robert and his pretty wife Jill. Same exact British lady from Clearwater was there! She talked to me all night. She wants me to come to her house in Florida so I can learn new things!"
> "to get away from Mary?"

Earlier in the journal, page 1 (OCR id 29094):

> "That my mom lied about Mr. Glickman all the time."
> "She lied about work trips about Michigan and about Clearwater."
> "Now he is dead and I am being sent to live with her friend"

Page 3 (OCR id 10701):

> "I am lost. Mr. Mody. Mr. Robert. Mr. Sant. Mr. Ludwig. Mr. Cecchi. Mr. Mora. Mr. Goodlatte. Mr. Atkins are not who they say!"

### VERIFIED
- A victim's confidential journal describes being taken to a party at a "huge house" to meet "Mr. Robert and his pretty wife Jill"
- The "British lady from Clearwater" was present at this party -- almost certainly Ghislaine Maxwell (British, known to operate in Florida)
- This appears to describe a recruitment event: Maxwell "talked to me all night" and invited the victim to "come to her house in Florida"
- The victim had prior contact with Maxwell (or a British woman) in Clearwater, FL before this party
- "Mr. Robert" appears again on page 3 in a list of men the victim identifies as abusers
- The victim references "Mary" -- possibly a guardian or family friend
- "Mr. Glickman" died before the events described, and the victim's mother was connected to him

### UNVERIFIED
- The identities of "Mr. Robert" and "Jill" remain unknown
- The location of the "huge house" party is not specified
- Whether "Mr. Robert" on page 3 is the same person as "Mr. Robert" from the party is likely but not certain
- No corroborating documents identify this couple

### NEW FINDINGS FROM THE SAME JOURNAL ([EFTA02731420](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2012/EFTA02731420.pdf))
The journal contains a significant list of alleged abusers beyond Robert and Jill:

Page 3: Mr. Mody, Mr. Robert, Mr. Sant, Mr. Ludwig, Mr. Cecchi, Mr. Mora, Mr. Goodlatte, Mr. Atkins
Page 4 (OCR id 13253): Leon Black -- described biting the victim, blood on Jeffrey's carpet: "Who the fuck bites someone? Sick!" and "Mr. Black is so important for some reason over my health"
Page 5 (OCR id 28487): Mr. Colgan, Jeffrey treating victim as "special property," Ghislaine "working," Joe Gibbs described as "nice"
Page 6 (OCR id 36185): "Mr. Dana" (Rockefeller connection: "For being a Rockefeller that plane Mr. Dana had me on was scary!"), Larry Summers, Andrew ("I guess it is a royal thing. Gross! Andrew is like his brother in this way!")
Page 2 (OCR id 10096): Poem "Stopped Dead" directed at Leon Black with underlined words: "birth," "cry," "fatso millionaire," "it's violent," "goddamn baby screaming," "there's always a bloody baby," "your seven chins"
Page 6 (OCR id 24526): References sonogram photo: "I heard the heart beat even when she put her hands over my ears." References possible forced terminations: "Have these all been .... [MURDERS]? Does this make me a [KILLER]?"

### EXPANDED: DS9 COPY OF VICTIM JOURNAL CONFIRMS FBI CASE FILE INCORPORATION
The full-corpus revisit confirmed that the victim journal page ([EFTA02731420](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2012/EFTA02731420.pdf) p.2) is duplicated verbatim in DS9 as [EFTA00155037](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00155037.pdf) p.2. DS9 is the 50D/31E FBI case file -- this confirms the journal was formally incorporated into the federal investigation, not merely held as a supplemental document. Additional context pages from the same DS9 copy provide the Leon Black biting assault (p.6), sonogram/forced termination reference (p.10), and the Leonsis filming passage (p.14). The "Mr. Robert" from the party is NOT the same as the many "Mr. Robert" references in DS9 legal proceedings (attorney Robert Critton, Robert Trivers, Robert Peerless, etc.).

### EXPANDED: MR. GLICKMAN PARTIAL IDENTIFICATION
[EFTA00757914](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00757914.pdf) (DS9) contains an Epstein email to himself (jeevacation@gmail.com) listing "ron glickman" among personal contacts alongside other known associates ("john howard, jason, calkanis, Julia, dick merkin, miliken, jimmy coleman, schwatzman"). This is the first corpus hit connecting a Glickman to Epstein's personal network. "Ron Glickman" is a possible identification for the "Mr. Glickman" in the victim journal -- described as a person known to the victim's mother who died before the victim entered the Epstein network. Carl D. Glickman (Bear Stearns board member, [EFTA00729727](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00729727.pdf)) and Alan Glickman (Jeepers/Zwirn attorney, [EFTA00750416](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00750416.pdf)) also appear in DS9 but in unrelated contexts.

### MISSING
- No investigation into Clearwater, FL connections (Scientology headquarters is in Clearwater; this may or may not be relevant)
- No cross-reference with property records for "huge house" party location
- "Mary" -- unidentified guardian/caretaker figure
- Mr. Mody, Mr. Sant, Mr. Ludwig, Mr. Cecchi, Mr. Mora, Mr. Goodlatte, Mr. Atkins -- none of these names have been investigated

---

## LEAD 12: "THE GREGORYS" -- FLIGHTS OF HORROR

### Prior Claim
A victim's journal describes "the Gregorys" in connection with "flights of horror," alongside other named individuals.

### Source Documents Found
- **[EFTA02731420](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2012/EFTA02731420.pdf)** - Dataset 12, same journal as Lead 11 (page 1, OCR id 2322)

### Cross-Reference Search Results
- **Gregory Riches** -- appears in [EFTA00024018](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00024018.pdf) and related documents as an interior designer Epstein considered hiring (unrelated to abuse)
- **Sam Gregory** -- appears as an Epstein employee in [EFTA00024018](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00024018.pdf) (possible connection, but not confirmed)
- No other documents reference "the Gregorys" in an abuse or flight context
- The definite article "the" and plural form suggest a couple or family named Gregory

### What the Document Actually Says

[EFTA02731420](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2012/EFTA02731420.pdf), page 1 (OCR id 2322), states verbatim:

> "They are always flights of horror."
> "Whether its with Jeffrey, Mr. Leonsis, Mr. Case, Mr. Snyder, the Gregorys, Mr. Colgan or one being borrowed by a seemingly 'good' federal worker and even rented,"
> "it is all horror."
> "And nothing is as it seems"
> "I am so confused by everything and people you expect to be good like even old senators like George Mitchell who you think would be good like a grandpa are bad."
> "Mr. Kimsey is deranged"

### VERIFIED
- A victim's confidential journal names "the Gregorys" among people associated with "flights of horror" on Epstein's aircraft
- The Gregorys are listed alongside: Jeffrey (Epstein), Mr. Leonsis (Ted Leonsis), Mr. Case (Steve Case, AOL co-founder), Mr. Snyder (Dan Snyder, Washington NFL team owner), Mr. Colgan (unidentified), and a "seemingly 'good' federal worker"
- The same passage names George Mitchell (former Senate Majority Leader) and Mr. Kimsey (Jim Kimsey, AOL co-founder, deceased 2016)
- The phrasing "the Gregorys" with the definite article suggests a couple or family unit, not an individual

### UNVERIFIED
- The identity of "the Gregorys" is unknown
- Gregory Riches (interior designer) appears unrelated based on context
- No flight logs cross-referencing passengers named Gregory have been found in these files
- The "seemingly 'good' federal worker" is not identified

### EXPANDED: SAM GREGORY CONFIRMED AS "EMPLOYEE 1"
The full-corpus revisit confirmed Sam Gregory is designated "Employee 1" across five copies of the Maxwell case anonymous identifier list (marked "PROTECTED MATERIALS / ATTORNEY'S EYES ONLY"): [EFTA00024018](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00024018.pdf) (DS8), [EFTA00084754](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00084754.pdf), [EFTA00094813](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00094813.pdf), [EFTA00094814](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00094814.pdf), [EFTA00103418](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00103418.pdf) (all DS9). Designation as Employee 1 suggests he was the most senior or most relevant Epstein employee for prosecution purposes. Other named employees include Howard Schwartz (Employee 3), Matthew Meyers (Employee 4), Don DuBoulay (Employee 11), Bernard Udell (Employee 16), and Edward Hayes (Employee 22). The connection between Sam Gregory (Employee 1) and "the Gregorys" in the victim journal remains unconfirmed but is strengthened by his senior employee status. A Google+ notification ([EFTA00658333](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00658333.pdf), DS9) shows "Gregory Brown" adding Epstein, but this is insufficient to identify "the Gregorys." Gregorys Coffee charges on Epstein Amex statements ([EFTA01585812](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01585812.pdf), [EFTA01671962](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01671962.pdf), DS10) are a Manhattan coffee chain, not persons.

### NEW FINDINGS
The full "flights of horror" passage provides important context:
- The victim describes planes being "borrowed" and "rented," indicating the abuse network extended beyond Epstein's own aircraft
- A "federal worker" is named as participating, though described with the qualifier "seemingly 'good'" (suggesting the victim initially trusted this person)
- The DC power cluster is significant: Leonsis, Case, Snyder, Kimsey, and Mitchell are all Washington, DC-area figures with overlapping social circles
- Mr. Colgan appears in both this journal ([EFTA02731420](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2012/EFTA02731420.pdf)) and the other victim's journal ([EFTA02731465](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2012/EFTA02731465.pdf)), providing cross-victim corroboration of this individual

### EXPANDED: MR. COLGAN PARTIAL IDENTIFICATION
[EFTA01205013](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA01205013.pdf) (DS9) contains a letter from "MERRILL, PASTOR AND COLGAN ARCHITECTS" (927 Azalea Ln, Suite B, Vero Beach, FL 32963) recommending construction contractor Kevin Vanacore for "a large high end residential construction project in Florida." The firm's principals are Scott Merrill and George Pastor (license AA260006I2). Given that the victim journals name "Mr. Colgan" in the context of Florida and flights, that this architecture firm is based in Vero Beach, FL (Palm Beach County area), and that it was working on a residential project appearing in Epstein's files, this is the strongest identification lead for "Mr. Colgan" found to date. However, "Colgan" could be a partner's surname without that individual being involved directly. The "Mr. Colgan" reference appears in both the DS12 original ([EFTA02731420](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2012/EFTA02731420.pdf)) and the DS9 copy ([EFTA00155037](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00155037.pdf)).

### EXPANDED: MR. KIMSEY CONFIRMED AS AOL FOUNDING CEO
[EFTA01082667](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA01082667.pdf) (DS9) contains an advisory board or council member list identifying "James Kimsey Founding CEO of AOL, Washington" alongside Arnold Kanter (Scowcroft Group), Charles Kaye (Warburg Pincus), Michael Klein (Citigroup), and Gerald Levin (AOL Time Warner). This confirms the AOL nexus and DC establishment status previously identified.

### MISSING
- No investigation into Gregory-surnamed individuals in Epstein's broader contact lists (black book, phone records)
- The DC power cluster (Leonsis-Case-Snyder-Kimsey-Mitchell) warrants deeper investigation as an interconnected social group

### Systemic Issues Identified

1. **Evidence Processing Failure (Lead 9):** The FBI-USAO breakdown meant that the Maxwell prosecution was pursued without access to the majority of seized digital evidence. The prosecution memo itself acknowledges this gap. This raises questions about what evidence remains unexamined.

2. **Source Conflation (Lead 7):** The "database" claim was a civil lawsuit allegation reported in the media, not a DOJ investigative finding. Prior investigations treated this as established fact.

3. **Characterization Requires Nuance (Lead 8):** Rodgers' practice of not retroactively updating logs is a completeness limitation, not evidence of tampering. However, the Visoski proffer ([EFTA00159712](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00159712.pdf)) reveals Epstein directly ordered both pilots to stop recording passenger names around 2010/2011 -- making the incomplete records a result of both passive logging limitations AND active concealment directives.

4. **Single-Source Dependency (Leads 10-12):** The Ms. Vicki, Robert/Jill, and Gregorys leads each rest on a single victim journal with no corroborating documents. This does not make them false -- victim testimony is evidence -- but it means independent corroboration has not been found in the file set.

5. **DC Power Cluster:** The concentration of Washington, DC-area power figures (Leonsis, Case, Snyder, Kimsey, Mitchell, the federal worker) in the "flights of horror" passage suggests an organized social network, not random individual encounters.

## REVISIT INTEGRATION (2026-02-12)

**Classification: MODERATE REVISION**

Full-corpus revisit across all 12 datasets (1,380,937 documents) integrated above. Key changes:

1. **Lead 8 (Flight Logs):** Material correction -- Epstein ordered pilots to stop recording passenger names ~2010/2011 per Visoski proffer ([EFTA00159712](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00159712.pdf)). Changes characterization from passive incompleteness to directed concealment.
2. **Lead 9 (12 TB):** Factual correction -- "12 TB drive" confirmed by multiple DS9 emails with exact phrase.
3. **Lead 7 (Database/Masseuse List):** Expanded with FBI BLUF memo ([EFTA00172145](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00172145.pdf)) confirming no "client list" found, but masseuse list/black book/flight logs were the three key recovered documents.
4. **Lead 10 (Ms. Vicki):** New candidate Vicki Christianson (aviation officer, Santa Monica CA) identified but not conclusive.
5. **Lead 11 (Robert and Jill):** DS9 copy of victim journal confirmed in FBI case file ([EFTA00155037](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00155037.pdf)). Ron Glickman identified as possible "Mr. Glickman."
6. **Lead 12 (Gregorys/Colgan):** Sam Gregory confirmed as Employee 1. Merrill, Pastor and Colgan Architects (Vero Beach, FL) identified as Colgan lead. Kimsey confirmed as AOL Founding CEO.
7. **Victim journal formally incorporated into FBI case file** -- DS9 [EFTA00155037](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00155037.pdf) is the FBI's copy, establishing evidentiary weight.
