## 1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

The Epstein trafficking network operated a sophisticated, multi-modal transportation system designed to move victims between at least seven primary locations across four countries. The operation used private aircraft (Hawker 700, Boeing 727, Gulfstream G2B, Gulfstream G4/G550, Sikorsky S-76C++ helicopter, Bell 407 helicopter), ground transportation (car services, limousines, personal drivers, Michelle's Transportation LLC), maritime vessels (boats to/from islands), and commercial flights (Concorde, JetBlue, commercial airlines).

The network exploited the private aviation system to bypass normal customs and immigration controls. A key enabler was the use of model agency front companies (MC2 Model Management, Karin Models) to obtain "modeling visas" that provided legal cover for moving victims across international borders. Epstein's associates maintained relationships with customs officials, and the system tracked victim "availability and proximity using a database" ([EFTA00016836](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00016836.pdf)).

The charged trafficking conduct occurred across New York City, Palm Beach (Florida), Santa Fe (New Mexico), London (England), and the U.S. Virgin Islands, with international recruiting extending to Paris, Tel Aviv, Russia, Eastern Europe, and Belarus.

## 2. AIRCRAFT FLEET AND FLIGHT OPERATIONS

### 2.1 Aircraft Inventory (from [EFTA00030491](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00030491.pdf), [EFTA00021666](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00021666.pdf))

The network operated the following aircraft over approximately two decades:

| Aircraft | Tail Number | Approximate Period | Notes |
|----------|-------------|-------------------|-------|
| Hawker 700 (HS-700) | Unknown | 1991-2004 | First aircraft; mid-size jet fitting ~12 passengers ([EFTA00159180](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00159180.pdf)) |
| Gulfstream G2B | N909JE | ~1994-2000s | Purchased Feb 2, 1994. Silver with burgundy strip, burgundy carpet. Owned by Hyperion Air Inc. ([EFTA00159180](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00159180.pdf)) |
| Boeing 727 | N908JE | ~2000-2010s | Registered to JEGE Inc. 26-passenger capacity. ([EFTA00019442](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00019442.pdf), [EFTA00159180](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00159180.pdf)) |
| Gulfstream G4 | N120JE | ~2010-2017 | Transitional aircraft. CBP TECS records show use through 2018. ([EFTA00040497](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00040497.pdf)) |
| Gulfstream G550 | N212JE | ~2017-2019 | Owned by Plan D LLC. Used on arrest flight (Paris-Teterboro, July 6, 2019). ([EFTA00083891](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00083891.pdf)) |
| Sikorsky S-76C++ ("Air Ghislaine 2") | N722JE (prev. N331JE) | 2007-2019 | Serial 760750. Ownership chain: Air Ghislaine Inc -> Shmitka Air Inc -> Freedom Air International Inc -> ASI Wings LLC -> Hyperion Air LLC ([EFTA00075806](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00075806.pdf), [EFTA00040848](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00040848.pdf)) |
| Bell 407 ("Air Ghislaine 1") | N491GM | Various | Second helicopter ([EFTA00040848](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00040848.pdf)) |

**Key finding from [EFTA00030491](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00030491.pdf) (pilot interview notes):**
> "JE had the G2B from approximately 19[90s]. G2B was silver with burgundy strip at f[ront], burgundy carpet. JE had the Boeing form approximately 2[000s]. JE bought the G4 in approximately 201[0]. JE bought firs[t] helicopter in approximate[ly] 1999 and the mid-2000s, GM flew JE's [aircraft]. [Witness was] in the helicopter with GM... GM never owned any of the helicopters."

**Critical operational detail:** Employees were told no rules about interacting with passengers. They signed confidentiality forms about employment but were not given restrictions on observing who was aboard ([EFTA00030491](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00030491.pdf)).

### 2.2 Pilots

- **Larry Visoski (Chief Pilot from ~2004 onward):** Worked for Epstein from July 1991 to 2019; became Chief Pilot after Rodgers' demotion in Dec 2004. Signed aircraft registration documents as Manager/Director of Plan D LLC; involved in property management for Epstein entities in the Virgin Islands. Per proffer interview ([EFTA00159712](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00159712.pdf), Oct 2020): "Around 2010/2011 EPSTEIN tells VISOSKI and RODGERS to stop putting passenger names and only put EPSTEIN on passenger manifest and sheets." Had CBP officer "Bill Rouch" stored as "Customs STT" in his phone ([EFTA00080458](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00080458.pdf)). ([EFTA00037862](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00037862.pdf), [EFTA01266380](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01266380.pdf), [EFTA01364303](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01364303.pdf), [EFTA01684300](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01684300.pdf))
- **David Rodgers (Chief Pilot 1991-2004, then Captain):** Maintained flight logs; first flight with Epstein July 26, 1991. Per [EFTA02731168](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2012/EFTA02731168.pdf) p.7, Rodgers would NOT go back to add passenger names on prior flight logs -- prosecutors cited this to explain INCOMPLETE records, not tampering. Epstein ordered both pilots to stop recording passenger names circa 2010/2011 ([EFTA00159712](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00159712.pdf), [EFTA00159180](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00159180.pdf)). Rodgers continued employment and pay through NES LLC even after Epstein's July 2019 arrest. ([EFTA01684300](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01684300.pdf), [EFTA02731168](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2012/EFTA02731168.pdf))
- **Larry Morrison:** Regular Flight Engineer on the Boeing 727 ([EFTA00159180](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00159180.pdf))

From [EFTA00159180](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00159180.pdf) (Rodgers 17-page FD-302, Feb 2020):
> Aircraft progression: Hawker 700 (1991-2004, first aircraft, mid-size jet fitting ~12 passengers) -> Gulfstream G2B (purchased Feb 2, 1994) -> Boeing 727 (starting ~2000, owned by JEGE Inc., 26 passengers) -> Gulfstream (owned by Hyperion Air Inc., 12 passengers). Rodgers did not check IDs or DOBs of passengers. Maxwell gave travel schedule verbally, never written.

### 2.3 Flight Calendars ([EFTA00005994](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%204/EFTA00005994.pdf) - OCR Records)

Monthly flight calendars spanning 2017-2019 document a consistent rotation between three primary airports:

- **TEB** - Teterboro, NJ (New York area)
- **TIST** - US Virgin Islands (St. Thomas)
- **PBI** - West Palm Beach, FL (Palm Beach area)
- **KISP** - Long Island, NY (additional)
- **KBCT** - Boca Raton, FL (additional)
- **KBAF** - Westfield, MA (additional)
- **KFXE** - Fort Lauderdale, FL (additional)

The pattern shows flights cycling between New York (Teterboro), Palm Beach, and the Virgin Islands on a near-weekly basis.

### 2.4 Flight Logs as Evidence

- [EFTA00021689](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00021689.pdf): "Flight log provided to A. Kramer" (attorney) -- flight logs were subpoenaed

---

## 4. AIRPORT INFRASTRUCTURE AND CBP BYPASS

### 4.1 Teterboro Airport, NJ

Teterboro was the primary New York-area airport for Epstein's operations:

- **[EFTA00018147](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00018147.pdf):** "Billionaire Jeffrey Epstein expected to be charged in a sex trafficking scheme allegedly involving 'dozens' of victims after being arrested in Teterboro, New Jersey"
- **[EFTA00038049](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00038049.pdf):** FBI communications: "Subject possibly flying into Teterboro" -- pre-arrest surveillance
- **[EFTA01660622](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01660622.pdf):** Timeline confirms "7/6/2019 - Epstein arrested at Teterboro airport in New Jersey"
- **[EFTA01802220](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01802220.pdf):** "am 550 in Teterboro Now" -- communications about aircraft arrival
- **[EFTA02148154](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA02148154.pdf):** "FBO at Teterboro is: Atlantic Aviation" -- Fixed Base Operator identification
- **[EFTA02208331](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02208331.pdf)/[EFTA02209867](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02209867.pdf):** Multiple references to "Teterboro Meridian Aviation" as the handling facility; passengers "driven to Teterboro Meridian [Aviation]"

### 4.2 St. Thomas, USVI -- The Critical Chokepoint

The St. Thomas airport was the gateway to Epstein's island and a critical vulnerability in his operation:

- **[EFTA00016836](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00016836.pdf):** "air traffic controllers in the Virgin Islands observed Mr. Epstein leaving his private [jet] with girls who looked as young as 11"
- CBP sites at St. Thomas included both preflight and pre-departure inspection points ([EFTA00010062](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00010062.pdf))
- The deferred prosecution of MCC corrections officers (not CBP officers at St. Thomas) is documented in [EFTA00009786](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00009786.pdf), relating to the prison death, not the island operations

### 4.3 Palm Beach International / Private Aviation

- [EFTA00007157](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%204/EFTA00007157.pdf): Palm Beach Police report documents: "Epstein had left for the airport and his private jet was sitting on the tarmac. Epstein's private vehicle drove to the jet and unloaded packages into the jet. It appeared that Epstein left the county at this time."
- Multiple victim interviews describe being driven to the airport from Palm Beach residences

---

## 5. THE RECRUITING PIPELINE

### 5.1 The Palm Beach Pyramid Scheme Model

The most extensively documented recruiting operation was the Palm Beach "pyramid" model:

**[EFTA00009809](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00009809.pdf) (Epstein Indictment):**
> "To ensure a steady stream of minor victims, JEFFREY EPSTEIN asked and enticed certain victims in Florida to recruit other girls to engage in sex acts. EPSTEIN paid hundreds of dollars to victim-recruiters for each additional girl they brought to the Palm Beach Residence."

**[EFTA00008529](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%206/EFTA00008529.pdf) (Grand Jury Testimony):**
- Recruiter-victims were paid **$300 per new girl** brought to Epstein
- One victim recruited **approximately 20 to 50 girls** over a three-year period (ages ~14-17)
- When asked about preferences: "He did not like dark skinned or black girls"
- Epstein told recruiters: **"you know what I like"** -- understood to mean girls under 18
- "He didn't care how old they were as long as they weren't over 18"
- "he had preferred under 18 and that's what he wanted her to bring"
- Another witness: Epstein said **"the younger the better"** and "he likes the girls that are between the ages of 18 and 20" (contradictory statements reflecting manipulation)

**[EFTA00009550](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%207/EFTA00009550.pdf) (FBI testimony):**
> A recruiter "has been interviewed... And has he admitted to being a recruiter for Mr. Epstein? Yes, recruiter and driver."

This identifies **Tony Figurello** as an admitted recruiter and driver for Epstein in Palm Beach ([EFTA00085291](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00085291.pdf), [EFTA00179399](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00179399.pdf)). The dual role reveals that recruiters also served as drivers, physically transporting victims.

### 5.2 Recruitment Methodology

**[EFTA02731200](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2012/EFTA02731200.pdf):**
> "[Victim] described having been recruited by a friend at approximately age 13 or 14 to give massages to Epstein at the Florida residence. Over approximately two years, [victim] visited [regularly]."

**[EFTA02731082](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2012/EFTA02731082.pdf):**
> "On September 9, 2019, we interviewed [victim] in New York. During this interview, we discussed with [her] the process of her recruitment."
> "[Victim provided an] account of being recruited by Maxwell, abused by Maxwell and Epstein, engaging in paid sexualized massages with Epstein as a minor, recruiting othe[r victims]."

**[EFTA00029869](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00029869.pdf) (Trial Prep Notes):**
> "[Victim's mother] recalls the following callers to her phone regarding [daughter's] work in Palm Beach: Two male voices: One was a car service or driver picking up [the victim]"

This documents that car services/drivers called victims' homes directly to arrange transport.

### 5.3 School-Based Recruitment

From [EFTA02731200](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2012/EFTA02731200.pdf):
> "described having been recruited by a friend [at school]. Over approximately two years, [she] visited [Epstein's Florida residence repeatedly]."

**[EFTA00019314](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00019314.pdf):**
> "underage victims, who ranged in age from 14 to 17 years old. For example, when minor [victims arrived for] the appointments at Palm Beach, [staff] sometimes met them, walked them up to the [room and] set up the massage table for the appointment. After some of the appointments, [staff paid] victims in cash. Epstein encouraged minor victims to bring other girls to massage him, [leading to an] increasing number of victims coming to massage Epstein at his residences."

### 5.4 Maxwell's Direct Approach

**[EFTA01660679](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01660679.pdf):**
> "When complainant was 14 years old, Ghislaine Maxwell allegedly approached her about modeling, international travel, and massages."

**[EFTA02731168](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2012/EFTA02731168.pdf):**
> "She turn[ed] 14 years o[ld] that summer. [She] recalls that one day, she was sitting at a picnic table with friends when Ghislaine Maxwell walked by with her [dog]."

**[EFTA00008744](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%206/EFTA00008744.pdf) (Trial Testimony):**
> "[Victim] told [Maxwell] that she was... Maxwell offered to get her a passport so she would be able to travel."

This is critical: **Maxwell offered to obtain passports for underage victims to enable international transport.**

### 5.5 Mother-Facilitated Trafficking

**[EFTA01653060](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01653060.pdf):**
> "YOU are responsible for trafficking your own little sister. YOU are the reason [sister] was sexually assaulted because selling your shitty art was more important than your own sister."

This documents intra-family trafficking, where one sibling accuses another of delivering a younger sibling to the network.

---

## 6. MODEL AGENCY FRONT OPERATIONS

### 6.1 MC2 Model Management

**[EFTA01728258](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01728258.pdf) (MC2 Website Archive):**
> "World renowned modeling entrepreneur Jean Luc Brunel opened Karin Models in Paris, France decades ago, to be eventually known as a global modeling enterprise. After his reign with Karin Models, he launched the prestigious MC2 Model Management worldwide in October 2005, with offices in **New York, Miami, and Tel Aviv**."
> "Having discovered faces such as Christie Turlington, and molded the careers of celebrities such as Sharon Stone, Rebecca Romijn, Estella Warren, Milla Jovovich, Monica Belucci and Jerry Hall..."

**CRITICAL -- MC2 Submission Requirements ([EFTA01728258](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01728258.pdf), page 43):**
> "SUBMISSION REQUIREMENTS:

> Please do not wear any make-up in the photos submitted.
> Email your pictures to: scout@mc2mm.com"

The submission requirements explicitly targeted children as young as **13 years old** and required form-fitting clothing photos with no makeup -- designed to assess physical appearance of minors.

### 6.2 The Visa Pipeline

**[EFTA00016836](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00016836.pdf) (USVI Attorney General Lawsuit):**
> "[Epstein used] a ring of associates to rotate the women and girls in and out of sexual servitude, [obtaining] modeling visas to transport them across state lines and international borders, [and] tracked their availability and proximity using the database."

**DS9 direct Epstein emails on visa procurement:**
- [EFTA00935562](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00935562.pdf): Epstein to woman in Poland: "we need to deal with your papers next... we might try a modeling visa. put together all of your tear sheets"
- [EFTA00940633](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00940633.pdf): "your work is a model visa. ? how old are you now?" and "no, ss number is meaningless. the h 1 visa is very specific"
- [EFTA00696949](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00696949.pdf): Woman writes to Epstein: "I didn't think about a model visa" after discussing photos taken in Moscow
- [EFTA02567104](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02567104.pdf) (DS11): Email stating a woman "is here on a modeling visa so it is important to be able to show work"
- [EFTA00143406](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00143406.pdf): Attorney for Brunel's victims: modelling agencies "were used not only as a recruiting strategy for new victims to be trafficked but also as a gateway for trading victims internationally and for obtaining modeling visas"

This is the clearest evidence that modeling visas were systematically used as the legal mechanism to import victims internationally. Epstein's direct involvement in visa paperwork is now documented through first-person emails.

### 6.3 Daniel Siad's Role

**DS9 identifies Siad as recruiter** ([EFTA00083931](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00083931.pdf)): Brunel himself described Siad as "a 'scout' or recruiter of girls and/or women for J. Epstein." Siad had extensive connections to Hermes luxury brand executives (Francois Manalt, Francois Dore, Pierre Francois Le Poutre -- [EFTA00307001](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00307001.pdf)). Siad actively introduced women to Epstein via email ([EFTA00404287](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00404287.pdf)): "Dear Daniel and Jeffrey, I would love to meet your friend Jeffrey" with Epstein writing to Siad: "if your princess would like to come, she needs to schedule?" Contact info: +33633582532, +32489336992, photographtv.daniel@gmail.com.

**[EFTA01986452](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01986452.pdf):** Email from Daniel Siad to Jean-Luc Brunel with subject line: **"Commission de mes 2 filles Chez toi"** ("Commission for my 2 girls at your place")

**[EFTA01975079](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01975079.pdf):** Jeffrey Epstein emailed Daniel Siad directly, with Lesley Groff BCC'd -- showing the chain of command.

**[EFTA01777553](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01777553.pdf), [EFTA01796033](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01796033.pdf):** Additional Siad communications show ongoing coordination.

**[EFTA01324971](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01324971.pdf)/[EFTA00017957](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00017957.pdf):** Daniel Siad contact records maintained in the network's files, including phone numbers and email addresses.

### 6.4 Jean-Luc Brunel's Operations

> (U) From 07/09/2019 through 07/11/2019 [investigation activities]"

Brunel was investigated in the days immediately following Epstein's arrest on 7/6/2019.

**[EFTA01731021](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01731021.pdf):** FBI case file index includes:
> "(U) Interview of Jean Brunel"
> "(U) JEAN LUC BRUNEL"

### 6.5 Suspicious Activity Reports (SARs)

**[EFTA01656566](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01656566.pdf) (Financial Intelligence):**
> "the Subject appear to work as models, mainly residing in Russia"
> "not all the transactions being reported definitively involve women models[;] their ambiguous nature raises concern when [considered together]"

This SAR filing flagged financial transactions involving Russian models connected to Epstein's network, with 10 subjects reported. The TIN (Tax Identification Number) 770510487 appears repeatedly, linking the transactions to a specific institutional entity.

### 7.4 T-Visa Investigation

**[EFTA00023116](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00023116.pdf)/[EFTA00027558](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00027558.pdf):** "Question re T-Visa" -- prosecutors investigated whether T-visas (trafficking victim visas) applied. The T-visa question, combined with "currently legally in t[he country]" ([EFTA00023116](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00023116.pdf)), suggests prosecutors were evaluating victim immigration status.

### 7.5 Passport Confiscation as Control

**[EFTA00016836](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00016836.pdf):**
> "a 15-year-old girl attempted to swim off Mr. Epstein's [island to esca]pe after she was forced to engage in sex acts with Mr. Epstein and others. The girl was [held] captive on the island after he confiscated her passport."

> "Maxwell offered to get her a passport so she would be able to travel... [victim] told [Maxwell] that she was 14 years old."

This shows Maxwell directly facilitating travel documents for minors she knew to be underage.

## 11. METHODS OF CONTROLLING VICTIMS DURING TRANSPORT

### 11.1 Passport Confiscation

**[EFTA00016836](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00016836.pdf):**
> "The girl was [held] captive on the island after he confiscated her passport"

### 11.2 Financial Dependency

- Victims paid in cash after each encounter ($200-300 per visit)
- Epstein paid for travel, lodging, and expenses
- "Epstein then paid for [victim] to [travel to] New York" ([EFTA02731082](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2012/EFTA02731082.pdf))
- Train tickets purchased for victims: "I will be purchasing your train tic[ket]" ([EFTA02155465](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA02155465.pdf))

### 11.3 Threats and Intimidation

**[EFTA00008529](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%206/EFTA00008529.pdf):**
> "[Maxwell/associate] told her that if she didn't talk she'd be taken care of"

### 11.4 Isolation on Island

**[EFTA00016836](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00016836.pdf):**
> "a 15-year-old girl attempted to swim off Mr. Epstein's [island] after she was forced to engage in sex acts"

The island's geography meant victims had no means of independent departure, and passport confiscation reinforced this isolation.

### 11.5 Database Tracking

**[EFTA00016836](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00016836.pdf):**
> "tracked their availability and proximity using the database"

The network maintained a database to track where victims were located and when they were available, treating them as logistical assets.

### 11.6 Grooming Through Luxury

**[EFTA02731082](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2012/EFTA02731082.pdf):**
> "[Associate] told [victim] that [Epstein] and help[ed] in her with college."

Offers of college assistance, career help, and luxury experiences were used to maintain victim compliance during transport.

### 12.2 Single-Purpose Entities and Tail Number Changes

**[EFTA00023437](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00023437.pdf):**
> "No other aircraft registered to or indexed to Hyperion Inc/LLC, Plan D LLC, Ossa Properties Inc."

This confirms that these shell companies were used solely for Epstein's aircraft, with no legitimate business purpose.

**[EFTA00021666](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00021666.pdf):**
> "They changed the tail number... [in] August 2011 to N162AD"

Tail numbers were changed periodically, which had the effect of complicating aircraft tracking.

## ANALYTICAL CONCLUSIONS

### The Transportation System as Trafficking Infrastructure

The evidence reveals a purpose-built transportation system with the following characteristics:

1. **Layered entity structure:** Aircraft registered to multiple shell companies (JEGE, Hyperion, Plan D, Ossa, ASI Wings), tail numbers changed periodically, and no other aircraft registered to these entities — a structure consistent with obfuscation, though other explanations (liability isolation, tax structure) are possible.

2. **Private aviation to bypass screening:** By using Teterboro (private jet terminal), St. Thomas (private aviation facilities), and Palm Beach (private terminals), Epstein avoided the passenger screening, documentation, and witness exposure of commercial aviation.

3. **Modeling visas as legal cover:** The MC2 Model Management agency openly recruited girls ages 13-20 internationally, providing visa justification for bringing foreign victims into the United States.

4. **Integrated scheduling system:** Sarah Kellen and Lesley Groff coordinated a scheduling system where car services were dispatched to victims' homes, victims were driven to airports, and flights were arranged on private aircraft -- all controlled through Epstein's office.

5. **Database tracking of victims:** The network maintained a database tracking victim "availability and proximity" -- essentially a logistics management system for human trafficking.

6. **Island isolation as control:** Little St. James Island, accessible only by boat or helicopter, served as the ultimate controlled environment where passport confiscation and physical isolation prevented escape.

7. **International scope:** The Concorde to Paris, flights to London, MC2 offices in Tel Aviv, and recruiting from Russia/Belarus/Eastern Europe demonstrate a truly international trafficking operation.

8. **Institutional failures:** Air traffic controllers observed children as young as 11 departing Epstein's jet but no intervention is documented; the network used "modeling visas" with apparent institutional cooperation; CBP records were maintained but apparently did not trigger intervention despite the pattern of private jet travel to the Virgin Islands.
