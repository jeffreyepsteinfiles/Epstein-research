---

## SECTION 4: PROSECUTION EVIDENCE OF SCOPE

### 4A. Masseuse List
- A document titled "Masseuses" was recovered from Epstein's digital devices seized from Manhattan residence
- "The names listed are believed to be women and girls, some of which were identified minors, who were contacted" ([EFTA00038620](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00038620.pdf))
- Originally intended as Maxwell trial exhibit but not used
- Referenced in victim requests: prosecutors had list of names ([EFTA00021007](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00021007.pdf), [EFTA00024796](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00024796.pdf))
- Computers and paper directories with names/phone numbers of "masseuses" were collected around time of Florida investigation ([EFTA02731200](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2012/EFTA02731200.pdf) p.10)

> **[UPDATE — 2026-02-12]** DS9 contains emails with the actual document file **"USGME01088970_(masseuse_list).doc"** as an attachment ([EFTA00089863](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00089863.pdf), [EFTA00098034](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00098034.pdf)). The FBI Transparency Project timeline confirms "Black book, flight logs, masseuse list" were delivered to DOJ on 2/18/2025 ([EFTA00172473](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00172473.pdf)).

### 4B. Abuse Description (Standard Prosecution Language)
From multiple Maxwell indictment documents and prosecution memos:
> "Minor victims were subjected to sexual abuse that included, among other things, the touching of victims' breasts or genitals, placing a sex toy such as a vibrator on a victim's genitals, directing a victim to touch herself while he masturbated, and directing a victim to touch Epstein's genitals. MAXWELL... [victims] were groomed or abused at Epstein's residences in New York, Florida, and New Mexico, [and] MAXWELL's residence in London, England."

This language appears in: [EFTA00017726](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00017726.pdf), [EFTA00019314](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00019314.pdf), [EFTA00019537](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00019537.pdf), [EFTA00019543](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00019543.pdf), [EFTA00019546](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00019546.pdf), [EFTA00021826](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00021826.pdf), [EFTA00021829](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00021829.pdf), [EFTA00024516](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00024516.pdf), [EFTA00024523](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00024523.pdf), [EFTA00024539](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00024539.pdf), [EFTA00024553](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00024553.pdf)

### 4B-1. Scheduling Quantification (DS9)

Sarah Kellen Vickers plea drafts ([EFTA00089268](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00089268.pdf), [EFTA00079591](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00079591.pdf)) provide the first quantification of the scheduling operation:

| Metric | Value | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Total massage appointments | **Hundreds** | [EFTA00089268](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00089268.pdf)/00079591 |
| Frequency | **2-3 per day** | [EFTA00089268](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00089268.pdf)/00079591 |
| Duration of scheduling operation | **~3 years** (2002-2005) | [EFTA00089268](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00089268.pdf)/00079591 |
| Minors scheduled | **Dozens** | [EFTA00089268](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00089268.pdf)/00079591 |
| Age range of minor victims | **14-17 years old** | [EFTA00089268](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00089268.pdf)/00079591 |

At 2-3 massages per day over approximately 3 years (~1,095 days), this yields an estimated 2,190-3,285 total massage appointments. Lesley Groff's calendars independently corroborate "hundreds of appointments and flights with women in their teens or 20s" extending to the 2010-2018 period ([EFTA00144273](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00144273.pdf)).

The Kellen plea documents also reveal the prosecution treated Kellen as both victim and perpetrator. SDNY drafted two plea options: one neutral ("personal assistant") and one characterizing Kellen as a trafficking victim ("Epstein began sexually abusing her... included at least one instance in which Epstein forcibly raped [her]... controlled various aspects of [her] life, including her diet, her clothing, her hair, and her sleep").

### 4B-2. EVCP Detailed Claim (DS9)

[EFTA00068552](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00068552.pdf) contains a 6-page Epstein Victims' Compensation Program claim submission (Panish Shea & Boyle LLP, August 28, 2020):
- Victim was **13 years old** when she first met Epstein and Maxwell at a summer camp in 1994
- **Sexually abused more than 200 times** between ages 14 and 18 across Palm Beach, New York, New Mexico, and Los Angeles
- Maxwell "also personally abused [victim] on numerous occasions"
- Claim demanded $50 million against the Estate and $25 million against Maxwell
- Employee declarations corroborate: Alessi testified picking victim up from school, remembers her at Epstein's house from mid-to-late 1990s
- Flight logs from 1996-1997 contain victim's name as passenger
- The 1994 start date pushes the documented victimization timeline back earlier than most identified victims

### 4B-3. FBI Evidence Box Inventory (DS9)

[EFTA00066350](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00066350.pdf)-66359 documents a **19+ box physical evidence inventory** containing:

| Box | Key Contents |
|---|---|
| 1 | "Redwell with different files for each Jane Doe v. Epstein case" |
| 7 | 10+ individual testimony folders (2/6/07-5/22/07 Grand Jury testimony) |
| 9 | "White binder with Victim information," "Witness/Victim Names Contact List," "Flight Manifests," "Summary of Sexual Activity" |
| 10 | "Handwritten list of victims," Privilege Logs |
| 15 | Interview recordings (CDs, cassette tapes, VHS): multiple victim/witness interviews |
| 16 | "Victim List (file folder) -- includes 7/10/2008 Final Notification of Identified Victims" |

Box 9's "Summary of Sexual Activity" and Box 16's "7/10/2008 Final Notification of Identified Victims" have not been disclosed in the digital corpus.

### 4B-4. FBI Epstein Transparency Project (DS9)

[EFTA00172473](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00172473.pdf)-00172480 is the internal FBI operational summary of the Epstein file release:
- **116,792 total pages** processed across 6 case files
- **"Victims lists (multiple)"** delivered to DOJ on 3/18/2025
- "Black book, flight logs, masseuse list" delivered 2/18/2025
- Active investigation into "unauthorized destruction" of evidence
- 84 digital items, 70 general items delivered to DOJ on 2/28/2025

### 4B-5. SDNY Victim List Management (DS9)

SDNY maintained formal victim notification lists as Excel files:
- [EFTA00068047](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00068047.pdf): "US_v._Epstein_Victim_List.xlsx" created July 11, 2019
- [EFTA00084946](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00084946.pdf): Updated version noting 2 victims without contact info and 1 who opted out of notifications
- [EFTA00085273](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00085273.pdf): SDNY cross-referencing its list against the South Florida victim list
- [EFTA00071704](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00071704.pdf): Post-arrest additions: "None of these women are on the list of victims. Can I add them all?" / "Yes"

### Aggregate Assessment
The documentary record supports the following victim count ranges:

- **Florida operation (2002-2008)**: At minimum 35 identified victims, "well over 30" confirmed by FBI, likely 40-50+ given the recruitment pyramid structure where "Epstein paid hundreds of dollars to victim-recruiters for each additional girl."

- **Full scope (all locations, 1990s-2019)**: The USVI Attorney General's characterization of "hundreds" is the broadest official claim, supported by:
  - The computerized database of available girls maintained by the Epstein Enterprise
  - The masseuse list recovered from electronic devices
  - The geographic spread across 5+ locations over 20+ years
  - The recruitment pyramid model that continuously generated new victims
  - Air traffic controller observations of very young girls as late as 2018

- **Conservative documented minimum**: 35 (FBI Miami interviews) + "dozens" additional (SDNY) = **~60-80 individually identified victims** across both investigations.

- **Realistic total estimate**: Given the 20+ year duration, multiple locations, recruitment pyramid, and the USVI's "hundreds" characterization, the actual number of victims likely exceeds **100** and may approach or exceed **200**.

> **[UPDATE — 2026-02-12]** DS9 evidence strengthens the upper range of these estimates. The "hundreds of appointments" documented across two distinct periods (2002-2005 via Kellen plea drafts, 2010-2018 via Groff calendars) indicates the abuse was more extensive than the original "60-80" minimum suggested. SDNY victim notification lists were actively expanded post-arrest ([EFTA00071704](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00071704.pdf): "Can I add them all?"). The existence of multiple victim lists delivered to DOJ on 3/18/2025, 19+ boxes of physical evidence containing undisclosed victim files, and the Kellen plea quantification ("dozens of minors" scheduled for "hundreds of appointments" at a rate of "2-3 per day") support a realistic total that likely exceeds 200.

## KEY EVIDENTIARY GAPS

1. **Masseuse list contents**: The actual document file ("USGME01088970_(masseuse_list).doc") has been located as an email attachment in DS9 ([EFTA00089863](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00089863.pdf)), and the FBI Transparency Project delivered it to DOJ on 2/18/2025. However, the names on the list remain redacted in the publicly available documents.
2. **EVCP claim count**: The total number of claims filed with the Epstein Victims' Compensation Program is not stated in the available record. DS9 contains one detailed individual claim ([EFTA00068552](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00068552.pdf), 200+ assaults, $75M combined demand), and multiple court filings show Maxwell's defense attempted to subpoena all EVCP claims (quashed by Judge Nathan).
3. **USVI database**: The "computerized list of underage girls" referenced in the GVI complaint has not been detailed in the available documents.
4. **International victims**: The UK-based victim reference ([EFTA00095305](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00095305.pdf)) and Paris flight records suggest victims outside the US who may not appear in domestic counts.
5. **Post-NPA victims (2008-2019)**: The USVI allegation of abuse "as recently as 2018" implies victims from the decade after the Florida NPA who were never part of the original investigation.
