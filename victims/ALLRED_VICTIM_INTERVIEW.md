### Page 3: Introduction to Epstein -- Sister Connection

```
My sis introduced [me] to Epstein thru [healer]
My sis & I had apt together

[sis in] Hollywood - she moved back to city

After met [Epstein]:
- heard positive things about JE
- I was very skeptical
- I thought he had alternate motives
- didn't think someone could be this nice

My sis knew [him] for a couple of months
[He] was coming to CA

Bel Air Hotel

She told me to [meet] him
She introduced me to him

He showed a lot of interest in my life
my upbringing

He kept in touch after [to] pay for school

He would call me or have his assistant call me

I told him how I'd been homeless at 11 for [a while]
```

**KEY FACTS:** Sister introduced victim to Epstein through the spiritual healer connection. Sister had known Epstein for several months. He was visiting California, staying at Bel Air Hotel. He showed interest in victim's background, learned she had been homeless at age 11. Offered to pay for school. Called directly or had assistant call.

---

### Page 4: Grooming Phase -- Travel & First Assault

```
He suggested hair school
"I want [to] learn languages & to travel"
He said anywhere I wanna go

17yr - when met him

Kept touch via phone
He invited me to one of [his] houses w/ my sis
Went to a few: FL, US VI, NM I believe as well before [I] left for Spain

Being overwhelmed w/ houses
Luxury, lifestyle more [than] I'd ever seen
He was fun & light-hearted
Activities: trails, ride Hummers

[I was] very comfortable w/ him
Felt blessed & safe

1st visit he called me in to do massage
There - he put me in very uncomfortable situation
I [found] myself massaging him
He started [to] ask [me] to take off shirt

Remember feeling not knowing how to get out of it
- I froze, didn't know how to react
```

**KEY FACTS:** Victim was 17 when she met Epstein. He suggested hair school (leveraging her salon background). He invited her to properties with her sister. Visited FL, US VI, NM before Spain. First assault occurred during first visit -- called in for massage, escalated to asking her to remove clothing. Victim froze.

---

### Page 5: Vulnerability & Timeline -- Spain

```
Felt very vulnerable
Gave up my job & apt
Where was I gonna go

[Assaults were] not just during [massage]

We were wearing bathing suits
I don't want to go into detail

My sis [would] go back & forth to his houses
Had 2 be [at his] apt
I was primarily in LA

[For a] few months
[Then] January 2003 - turned 18 in Spain
4 months

He sent me to Spain
Studying Spanish
He paid for everything

[REDACTED] in his office - she helped me
[REDACTED] arrange it all
```

**KEY FACTS:** Victim gave up her job and apartment, becoming dependent. Multiple assaults, not just during massages. Also occurred while in bathing suits. She turned 18 in Spain in January 2003 (meaning she was born approximately January 1985, making her 16-17 during recruitment and initial assaults). Epstein sent her to Spain to study Spanish for 4 months, paying for everything. A female assistant (likely Ghislaine or office staff) helped arrange the trip.

---

### Page 6: Post-Spain -- Travel & Ghislaine

```
He knew how old I was
When came back from Spain
I went to VI or FL, not sure which one
It wasn't visiting him, it was home

I traveled w/ him for 2 yrs
W/in those yrs he sent me to school
When not in school, I was back w/ him

I told him I developed eating disorder
He told me to pack my stuff & he flew me to AZ

Phone calls
I was having hard time adjusting
He was my friend I thought, so I reached out to him a lot

I don't remember if I saw him after that

Ghislaine, [REDACTED]

Several diff [staff]:

Paris - chef cooked the best eggs
```

**KEY FACTS:** Epstein knew her age. After Spain, she returned to his properties -- it was "home" not visiting. Traveled with him for 2 years total. Developed eating disorder; he flew her to Arizona. Ghislaine Maxwell was present. Each property had different staff. In Paris, she remembers a chef who "cooked the best eggs."

---

### Page 7: Household Structure -- Ghislaine & Female Associate

```
Lived w/ him [in] NY
[Can't recall] apt in NY

[He would] summon [us] to house to go shopping [or] anything

Had multiple apt there
[Multiple] people lived [there]
[It] seemed [he] had several

[REDACTED] [was his] best friend
She was sweet & quiet
I understood that she was [his girlfriend]
It seemed that [they were together]

No one ever spoke about [the] relationship [with] JE

When I tried to open up to her about my assaults, she didn't relate
A bit standoffish
[She] wasn't very friendly

[I recall]
All went thru her & Ghislaine

[REDACTED] - more than 1x before I was 18 w/ [REDACTED]

Short blonde hair, brown eyes, not [a] lot [of] makeup
Older than I was
Guess that she's 5[+] older
Don't remember if [she] talked about my age
```

**KEY FACTS:** Victim lived with Epstein in NY. He had multiple apartments. A female associate described as his "best friend" -- sweet, quiet, understood to be his girlfriend. When victim tried to discuss her assaults, this woman "didn't relate" and was standoffish. All arrangements went through this woman AND Ghislaine. A second female (short blonde hair, brown eyes, minimal makeup, 5+ years older than victim) had contact with victim "more than 1x before I was 18."

---

### Page 8: Other Girls & FL Household

```

  but didn't know why

```

**KEY FACTS:** CRITICAL -- "[REDACTED] touched me during both" -- someone other than Epstein assaulted her. The people she saw most: JE (Jeffrey Epstein), GM (Ghislaine Maxwell), and 3 other redacted individuals. Many other girls her age came and went -- some for days, some for just 1-2 hours. In FL: girls constantly coming in and out. Jeffrey always woke early for coffee. Very private/secretive operation.

**KEY FACTS:** Girls came to the kitchen saying they were "here to see Jeffrey." Very secretive operation. On the island: Jean-Luc Brunel and Naomi Campbell are named as visitors. Jean-Luc described as one of Epstein's best friends, owned/worked for modeling agency, "very eccentric, small, colorful" -- "saw him quite a bit, he traveled w/ us." This is a firsthand account placing Brunel as a constant traveling companion.

**KEY FACTS:** Extensive travel documented photographically: Paris (multiple), USVI (helicopter, boat), Ecuador, Disney World. Jean-Luc Brunel took some of the photos -- confirming his presence on trips. Ecuador travel is notable and rarely mentioned in Epstein materials. **UPDATED (typed FD-302, [EFTA01245662](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA01245662.pdf) p.7):** The Ecuador photo shows four identified individuals: "MAXWELL (in the blue shirt), [victim] (in the green pants), EPSTEIN, and BRUNEL (in the pink top). This photo was taken in Ecuador." This is one of the few photographs placing all three principals (Epstein, Maxwell, Brunel) in the same frame with a victim at an international location.

### Page 15: Financial Control & Clothing Control

```
They gave me a phone

I'd fly commercially to [his] properties
Schedule thru [his] houses

Only see [REDACTED] in NY in person

He helped me open 1st bank account
Set up credit card

[Account] was in my name

Paid for my school
Sometimes gave me cash
[He] gave me gold ring from Egypt, 600 B.C.
Left it in NY when I left

He took me shopping
HE WAS VERY CONTROLLING ABOUT WHAT WE WEAR[wore]
He was buying so he picked
```

**KEY FACTS:** Epstein gave victim a phone. She flew on Gulfstream and a larger plane. He set up bank account, credit card, had banker help. Provided letter stating she resided with him. Gave her an ancient Egyptian gold ring (600 B.C.). **"He was very controlling about what we wear -- he was buying so he picked."** Classic control/grooming: financial dependence, clothing control, isolation.

---

### Page 16: Mind Control & "Harem" Ideology

```
[He] believes monogamous way of life is not way to live
It's not healthy to be in monogamous relationship

Idea to build harem [written as "harun"]
Went to Spain together to build this

I trusted him a lot and believed a lot of what he said
IT WAS ALL MIND CONTROL

He asked me a very random question if I thought it was wrong for a [older man to be with a young girl]
[**CORRECTION from typed FD-302 ([EFTA01245662](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA01245662.pdf) p.5):** Epstein actually asked the victim "if she thought it was wrong for a man to put women's faces on children's bodies to masturbate to them" -- a description of morphed CSAM, substantially different from the handwriting interpretation above.]

I said I think that's wrong

Phoenix
Vegas is close
[called] for resources
```

**KEY FACTS: CRITICAL**
- Epstein told victim monogamy was unhealthy
- **"Idea to build harem" -- Epstein openly discussed building a harem**
- Spain trip was connected to this "harem" plan
- Victim states: **"It was all mind control"**
- Epstein tested victim by asking if she thought it was wrong (handwritten notes suggest: "for an older man with a young girl"; **typed FD-302 correction:** Epstein asked whether she thought it was wrong "for a man to put women's faces on children's bodies to masturbate to them" -- a description of morphed CSAM) -- she said yes, it was wrong
- References to Phoenix and Vegas -- possibly additional locations or contacts

## CROSS-REFERENCE: [EFTA00022133](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00022133.pdf) (9-PAGE VICTIM ACCUSATION COMPILATION)

This document compiles public press reporting and hearing transcript information about Epstein victims. Four Gloria Allred clients are listed:

### Jane Doe 9 (Gloria Allred) -- New Mexico
> "Sexually molested by him for many hours"
> "Positioned me by laying me on his floor so that I was confronted by all the framed photographs on his dresser of him smiling with wealthy celebrities and politicians."
> "After he finished with me, he told me to describe in detail how good my first sexual experience felt."

### Jane Doe 10 (Gloria Allred) -- New Mexico
> Recruited by unidentified female
> Epstein asked if she would give him a massage
> Over the course of four visits, eventually progressed to "forced oral copulation"
> Paid money

### Jane Doe 11 (Gloria Allred) -- New York
> Raped by Epstein at 16 years old
> "Here, come. Come help me with a kink in my shoulder while we finish our discussion." A large vibrator and a couple of hundred dollars, disgust and dirty secret, more praise and imparted wisdom from a godlike figure, a deliberate diabolical depression of grooming and submission for his pleasure and release.
> "Even if I resisted, I was no match for him. I felt powerless, ashamed, and embarrassed. I wanted to vomit remembering these moments."
> "washed my entire body compulsively in the shower"
> **"He forcefully penetrated me. I was numb. There was pain, but his use of the vibrator and his fingers in previous sessions with me had left a black hole-like void between my legs. I protested, but he forced my face into the bed to stifle my cries. That was my first time."**
> Paid a few hundred dollars

### Jane Doe 12 (Gloria Allred) -- New York
> Recruited by unidentified woman
> In Epstein mansion, he had a white robe on, then took it off and locked the door
> Got close to her, touched her genitals. She refused him. He went to massage table and showed her the vibrator.

### Assessment: Which Jane Doe is [EFTA00004070](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%203/EFTA00004070.pdf)?
The [EFTA00004070](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%203/EFTA00004070.pdf) victim's profile (NM + FL + Paris + VI, recruited through sister, age 17, 4 assaults before 18 across Paris/NM/FL) does NOT precisely match any single Jane Doe 9-12 from the hearing compilation. The compilation covers hearing testimony (likely the 2019 CVRA hearing), while the interview notes are far more detailed. The victim's mention of New Mexico assaults and multi-location abuse pattern could align with **Jane Doe 9** or **Jane Doe 10**, but neither description fully captures the travel extent described in the notes. **It is possible this victim is Jane Doe 11** -- raped at 16 (consistent with age 17 at meeting, turning 18 in Jan 2003), the detail about "grooming and submission for his pleasure" and "forced my face into the bed" aligns with the violence level described. However, Jane Doe 11's location is listed as New York while [EFTA00004070](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%203/EFTA00004070.pdf) describes assaults in Paris/NM/FL. This may reflect the compilation only listing the primary/hearing-testimony location.

## CROSS-REFERENCE: [EFTA00011526](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00011526.pdf) -- ATTORNEY PROFFER (March 1, 2021)

A separate Allred/Wang client had a later proffer to SDNY:

```
Call with AUSA [REDACTED], Attorneys Mariann Wang & Gloria Allred

MW & GA wanted to provide attorney proffer of additional information their
client [REDACTED] had disclosed since being interviewed by SDNY & FBI in 2020.
[REDACTED] is available to be re-interviewed if necessary.

[REDACTED] had subsequent interactions with Epstein beyond November 2017,
those interactions took place in December 2018 - July 2019

- Accurate that JE lured [victim] to Paris & to Florida with offer of employment
- Accurate that [victim] left and did not want to deal with JE again
- JE & another woman named [REDACTED] (spelling unknown) kept reaching out
- [victim] took up offer, and JE bought a ticket to travel to NY
- JE said, in essence, [victim] owed [him] and felt obligated to agree to
  additional trips

- Another trip to Florida & VI, sexual abuse in both
- [victim] also went to JE's Paris apartment when already in Paris
- She talked about a dental issue, JE had [staff] arrange dentist appointments
  and flew [victim] to NY for dental appointments
- Appointments were right around the time when JE was arrested
- [victim] interacted with [REDACTED] around that time

- JE would ask [victim] to find girls for him
- JE asked [victim] to meet with a young (18/19) girl for coffee in Russia
- [victim] did so, but does not recall her name
- Just told JE that the girl seemed fine
```

**NOTE:** This proffer describes a DIFFERENT victim (interactions through 2017-2019), not the [EFTA00004070](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%203/EFTA00004070.pdf) victim (whose relationship ended ~2004). However, both are Allred/Wang clients, demonstrating Epstein's continued predation through at least July 2019 -- one month before his arrest.

The [EFTA00004070](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%203/EFTA00004070.pdf) victim describes:
- **Jean-Luc Brunel** -- Named in both the interview and the first victim journal ([EFTA02731393](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2012/EFTA02731393.pdf) references Brunel in the accusation compilation context)
- **Naomi Campbell** -- Named as island visitor; Campbell also appears in Epstein's correspondence
- **Ghislaine Maxwell** -- Named as "very intimidating, very cold" -- consistent with multiple victim descriptions
- **"Harem" ideology** -- The interview victim says Epstein wanted to "build [a] harem"; the victim journals document Epstein's eugenics/baby plans and forced pregnancies
- **Mind control** -- Interview victim uses the phrase "mind control"; the journal victims describe systematic psychological manipulation
- **Clothing control** -- Interview victim says "very controlling about what we wear"; consistent with the modeling/Victoria's Secret pipeline

### Allred/Wang SDNY Scheduling Correspondence: [EFTA00040390](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00040390.pdf)

DS9 counterpart of [EFTA00013253](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00013253.pdf). 6-page email chain (Aug-Nov 2020) containing victim scheduling with additional detail. Mariann Wang writes regarding photographs found in Epstein's possession: "Re the photograph info especially, we don't want to convey the info to our clients until we understand the scope/clarifications." This indicates SDNY may have found photos of these victims in seized evidence.

### Naomi Campbell Corroboration Chain

Three independent sources now confirm Campbell's presence in Epstein's orbit: (1) this victim (island), (2) pilot Larry Visoski confirming Campbell on the aircraft alongside Brunel ([EFTA00159483](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00159483.pdf)), and (3) a separate victim (DOB 4/7/1986, met Epstein via David Blaine) placing Campbell at an Epstein dinner in New York ([EFTA00153851](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00153851.pdf)). Calendar entries show continued Epstein-Campbell contact through at least 2015.

### Joseph "Gypsy" Alvarez -- Identified Procurer

Text messages ([EFTA01250066](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA01250066.pdf), DS9, 7 pages, Jul 2020-Apr 2021) show both FBI/SDNY and Maxwell's UK-based defense investigators (BGS Ltd, "managed by very senior ex Scotland Yard detectives") attempted to contact Alvarez. He is listed in [EFTA00098755](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00098755.pdf) alongside Maxwell, Groff, and Visoski in the loyalty tier expected to "remain loyal to JE during any criminal investigation."
