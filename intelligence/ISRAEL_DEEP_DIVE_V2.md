# EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

This report is the definitive analysis of Israeli connections within the 218GB DOJ Epstein document corpus. It consolidates findings from all prior sessions and adds deeper readings of every relevant document. The evidence breaks into six categories:

1. **Ehud Barak** -- 3,756 documents (25+ in original databases; 1,689 in DS9 + 1,076 in DS10 + 978 in DS11 from the full email corpus) establishing a deeply integrated personal and logistical relationship with Epstein spanning 2010-2019, including a staffed apartment in Epstein's trafficking-linked building, a brokered meeting with Steve Bannon, presence on Epstein's calendar alongside Leon Black, Larry Summers, and Peter Thiel on a single day, and extensive Carbyne/Reporty investment correspondence (see below).

2. **Nicole Junkermann** -- 4,182 documents (10+ in original databases; 1,758 in DS9 + 1,198 in DS10 + 1,218 in DS11 from the full email corpus) across an 11+-year relationship (2008-2019, including prison-era contact), including Epstein brokering her introduction to Leon Black, a January 2019 island trip alongside Steve Bannon and Sultan bin Sulayem, business correspondence through March 2018, and Carbyne investment negotiation emails detailing exact financial splits.

3. **The "Intelligence Agencies" Reference** -- A social media post by George B. Tonks captured by the FBI in which a third party states: "If we are collaborating with intelligence agencies they are hardly going to listen to you Maria." This appears in 4 EFTA documents as part of a multi-page collection of social media screenshots, NOT as an FBI investigative finding.

4. **The Allen/Oren/Tal Victim Account** -- An NTOC tip in which a 16-year-old model reports rapes at Epstein's New York parties by three brothers (Allen, Oren, Tal), annotated by the FBI as "possibly identifiable as Alexander brothers." The names are Hebrew/Israeli in origin.

5. **Israeli Military Access** -- Epstein toured Israeli military bases during Passover 2008 with "Friends of Israel" chairman Benny Shabtai, while under criminal charges. IDF-branded clothing (sweatshirt and T-shirt with Hebrew text) and a white military dress uniform with medals (national origin unidentified) were found on Little Saint James island.

6. **The Acosta "Intelligence Asset" Admission** -- A Daily Beast article in the FBI files states Acosta told Trump transition interviewers: "I was told Epstein 'belonged to intelligence' and to leave it alone." Under oath, Acosta carefully qualified his denial.

**Corrected Findings (Full Corpus Expansion, Feb 12, 2026):** The original report's negative findings were based on the redaction and OCR databases. The full email corpus (1,380,937 docs across all 12 datasets) overturns several of these. **Carbyne** now yields 50 documents (25 DS9 + 25 DS11) and **Reporty** yields 324 documents (196 DS9 + 25 DS10 + 103 DS11), including complete investment structures and board reports. **Unit 8200** yields 11 documents and **Shin Bet** yields 23, likely from news articles forwarded within the email corpus. **Mega Group** yields 4 documents (likely false positives from Wikipedia/news). **Ben-Menashe** and **LAKAM** remain confirmed at ZERO across the full 1.38M-document corpus. Additionally, an FBI CHS FD-1023 document ([EFTA00090314](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00090314.pdf)) contains a source claim that Epstein "belonged to both U.S. and allied intelligence services" and "trained as a spy under" Barak -- see Part VII below.

# PART I: EHUD BARAK -- COMPLETE DOCUMENT ANALYSIS

## Total Documents: 3,756 across all document collections (25+ in redaction/OCR databases; 1,689 in DS9 + 1,076 in DS10 + 978 in DS11 from full email corpus)

Ehud Barak -- former Prime Minister of Israel (1999-2001), former Defense Minister (2007-2013), and former Chief of Staff of the IDF -- is the most frequently appearing Israeli figure in the Epstein corpus. The DS9 expansion reveals thousands of calendar entries, schedule pages, and email chains, including Carbyne/Reporty investment correspondence documented in Part VII below.

**Relationship Origin:** Barak has publicly stated he was introduced to Epstein in 2003 by former Israeli President Shimon Peres at a Washington event attended by "American dignitaries." No EFTA document independently corroborates a specific 2003 meeting. Pre-2010 indicators confirm the relationship predates the first direct documentary evidence: by 2009, attorneys in a victim civil suit deposition already knew about the connection — a witness was asked whether Barak was "another person that Epstein procures underage minor females for" ([EFTA00159250](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00159250.pdf)). A July 2010 Daily Beast article in the FBI files identified Barak as a "prominent passenger on [Epstein's] private jets" based on pilot logs from civil discovery ([EFTA00206574](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00206574.pdf)). The earliest direct EFTA documentary evidence is September 2010: Epstein connecting Barak with Tom Barrack ([EFTA02422168](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02422168.pdf)) and organizing a Barak dinner with Jes Staley ([EFTA02422165](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02422165.pdf)) — the tone shows a fully established relationship, not a new introduction. The Carbyne/Reporty business partnership is first documented December 2014. The documented relationship runs through at least March 2019 (apartment cleaning, [EFTA02278459](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02278459.pdf)).

## A. Direct Email Communications

### [EFTA01802812](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01802812.pdf) -- Direct Email from ehbarak (April 17, 2016)
- **Redaction content:** "April 17, 2016, ehbarak [...] wrote:"
- **Nature:** An email FROM Barak's email address (ehbarak@...) to Epstein or Epstein's staff. The body is redacted but the metadata confirms direct electronic correspondence.
- **Significance:** Proves Barak maintained direct email contact with Epstein's network well after Epstein's 2008 conviction.

### [EFTA01960277](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01960277.pdf) -- "To: ehud barak" (Undated)
- **Redaction content:** "To: ehud barak" / "tomorrow try to coordinate" / "I am flexible"
- **Nature:** Epstein or staff writing directly TO Barak's email, discussing scheduling flexibility.

### [EFTA02575361](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02575361.pdf) -- Epstein to ehud barak (September 21, 2013)
- **OCR content:** "Jeffrey Epstein <jeevacation@gmail.com> Saturday, September 21, 2013 3:45 PM / ehud barak; Lesley Groff"
- **Nature:** Epstein emailing Barak directly from his personal Gmail, CC'ing his executive assistant Lesley Groff.

### [EFTA02589113](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02589113.pdf) -- "hope you are having fun" (September 9, 2014)
- **OCR content:** "jeffrey E. <jeevacation@gmail.com> Tuesday, September 9, 2014 11:37 AM / ehud barak / hope you are having fun"
- **Nature:** A casual personal email from Epstein to Barak, suggesting an informal friendship.

### [EFTA01903624](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01903624.pdf) -- Subject "Ehud Barak" (Undated)
- **Redaction content:** "Subject: Ehud Barak"
- **Nature:** An email with Barak as the subject line, suggesting he was a topic of discussion among Epstein's staff or contacts.

## B. The Barak-Bannon Meeting Brokered by Epstein

### [EFTA02633609](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02633609.pdf) -- Epstein Brokers Barak-Bannon Meeting (February 25, 2019)
- **Full OCR content:**
  > "J <jeevacation@gmail.com> Monday, February 25, 2019 11:29 AM / ehbarak / Re: JE/SB"
  >
  > "steve canceled, sick in wash. you can still come or do later. or come anytime today tomorrow and if you like we can get him on the phone"
  >
  > Original from Barak: **"Good idea. Done. EB"**
  >
  > Epstein's original: **"steve bannon here tomorrow morning if you want to join. 930?"**

- **Significance:** This document is extraordinary. Five months before Epstein's arrest, he was actively brokering meetings between:
  - **Ehud Barak** -- Former Israeli Prime Minister and Defense Minister
  - **Steve Bannon** -- Former White House Chief Strategist and Trump ally
  - Barak responds with enthusiasm ("Good idea. Done.") to meeting Bannon at Epstein's residence
  - When Bannon cancels due to illness, Epstein offers alternatives including a phone call
  - The subject line "JE/SB" is coded (Jeffrey Epstein/Steve Bannon)

### [EFTA02518862](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02518862.pdf) -- Nili Priel Schedules Ehud's Time (February 28, 2018)
- **Full OCR content:**
  > "jeffrey E. <jeevacation@gmail.com> Wednesday, February 28, 2018 10:21 PM / Nili Priel / Re:"
  >
  > From Nili Priel: **"Monday Ehud is free from 10:30 AM until 3:30 PM - anytime in between"**

- **Nature:** Barak's assistant (Nili Priel) coordinates Barak's availability directly with Epstein's personal email. This indicates a routinized scheduling relationship where Barak's calendar was managed in coordination with Epstein's.

## C. The Barak Dinner Circuit (2010-2017)

### [EFTA02422165](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02422165.pdf) -- Jes Staley Attends Ehud Barak Dinner (September 20, 2010)
- **Full OCR content:**
  > "Jeffrey Epstein [jeevacation@gmail.com] / Lesley Groff / Mon 9/20/2010 7:08:43 PM / Jes-Ehud Barak dinner / **Jes plans to attend the Ehud Barak dinner** (I hit send too quick last time)"

- **Significance:** Epstein organized a dinner FOR Ehud Barak that Jes Staley (then JPMorgan executive, later CEO of Barclays) attended. Staley was later accused by a victim of forced sex acts and "rough sex" ([EFTA01656173](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01656173.pdf)). This places a future accused sexual abuser at an Epstein-organized event honoring the former Israeli PM.

### [EFTA02422168](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02422168.pdf) -- Tom Barrack-Ehud Barak Introduction (September 16, 2010)
- **Full OCR content:**
  > "Jeffrey Epstein [jeevacation@gmail.com] / Lesley Groff / Thur 9/16/2010 3:17:47 PM / **Tom Barrack-Ehud Barak** / ILM with Tom's assistant Cate and emailed her your exact wording as well. She will be in touch."

- **Significance:** Epstein actively connected Tom Barrack (Colony Capital founder, later acquitted of charges of acting as an unregistered foreign agent of the UAE in November 2022) with Ehud Barak. The phrasing "your exact wording" suggests Epstein was carefully managing the introduction's language, indicating a brokerage role.

### [EFTA01923347](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01923347.pdf) -- "12pm meeting w/Mort and Ehud Tomorrow" (Undated)
- **Redaction content:** "Subject: 12pm meeting w/Mort and Ehud Tomorrow"
- **"Mort"** likely refers to Mort Zuckerman (Boston Properties, US News & World Report), whom Epstein controlled financially -- another document ([EFTA02518881](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02518881.pdf)) shows Epstein managed "All trusts, tax returns, will, art inventory, BXP filings, Daily News financials" for Zuckerman.

### [EFTA01955948](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01955948.pdf) / [EFTA02128207](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA02128207.pdf) -- LUNCH w/Ehud Barak & Joel Klein (Undated)
- **Redaction content:** "TBD LUNCH w/Ehud Barak & Joel Klein" / "Updated Invitation: 12:30pm Lunch w/Ehud Barak"
- **Joel Klein** was NYC Schools Chancellor (2002-2010) and later CEO of Oscar Health / Amplify (News Corp). This places Barak at lunches with a major US education and media figure, brokered by Epstein.

### [EFTA02138171](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA02138171.pdf) / [EFTA02138185](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA02138185.pdf) -- "Having Ehud Barrak to his home on Tuesday"
- **Redaction content:** "having Ehud Barrak to his home on Tuesday"
- **Note:** Barak's name is misspelled as "Barrak" (double R), suggesting this was written by someone unfamiliar with the correct spelling -- possibly household staff or a social contact, not Barak himself.
- **Nature:** Epstein hosting Barak at his private residence (likely 9 East 71st Street).

### [EFTA02154241](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA02154241.pdf) -- 8:30am Breakfast w/Ehud Barak (November 28, undated year)
- **Redaction content:** "8:30am Breakfast w/Ehud Barak and [...] When: Wed Nov 28 8:30am / 9:30am East"
- **Nature:** Early morning breakfast meeting, calendar alert format.

### [EFTA02199213](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA02199213.pdf) / 02199243 / 02208207 -- 9:00am BREAKFAST w/Ehud (2017)
- **Redaction content:** "Alert - 9:00am BREAKFAST w/Ehud" / "Alert - 9:00am BREAKFAST w/Ehud and Tom" / "Alert - 9:00am BREAKFAST w/Ehud"
- **"Tom"** likely Tom Barrack or Tom Pritzker, both of whom had overlapping Epstein relationships.

### [EFTA02211724](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02211724.pdf) -- 5:00pm Appt w/Ehud (2017)

### [EFTA02050653](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA02050653.pdf) -- "1pm w/Ehud" (Undated)
- **Redaction content:** "should 1pm w/Ehud be L[unch]"
- **Nature:** Staff query about whether a 1pm meeting with Ehud should include lunch.

### [EFTA02052245](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA02052245.pdf) / [EFTA02052296](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA02052296.pdf) -- Lunch w/Ehud (Undated)
- **Redaction content:** "for lunch w/Ehud" / "Alert - 12:00pm LUNCH w/Ehud"

### [EFTA02072207](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA02072207.pdf) -- "should noon today w/Ehud" (Undated)

- **Nature:** Staff inquiry about whether Barak would attend an event.

## D. Ehud and Nili -- Arrival Coordination

### [EFTA02065729](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA02065729.pdf) / [EFTA02065821](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA02065821.pdf) / [EFTA02067253](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA02067253.pdf) -- Ehud/Nili Arrive Early
- **Redaction content:** "Reminder: Ehud/Nili arrive early" / "Ehud/NILI arrive early" / "Subject: Re: Reminder: Nili and Ehud arrive"
- **Nature:** Multiple emails coordinating the early arrival of Ehud Barak and "Nili" at an Epstein-related venue. Nili is identified as **Nili Priel**, Barak's assistant/scheduler, confirmed by [EFTA02518862](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02518862.pdf) and 7+ other documents showing her coordinating with Epstein's staff.
- **Additional Nili documents identified:**
  - [EFTA01798885](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01798885.pdf): "nili Priell"

## E. The 301 East 66th Street Nexus -- Barak's Apartment

### [EFTA02278459](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02278459.pdf) -- THE KEY DOCUMENT (March 4, 2019)
- **Full OCR content:**
  > "merwin dela cruz / Leo / Mon 3/4/2019 3:58:37 PM / Re: clean Ehud's apt at 11am/clean 2G"
  >
  > "ok, got it, so Ehud will get cleaned today at 11am and then 2G on Wed. that is totally fine also! We have a guest arriving for 2G on Friday"
  >
  > From Merwin Dela Cruz: "Sorry for the confusion Les. I need Leo to start cleaning 9 East tomorrow (Tuesday) if JE is coming back on Wednesday. He will not be able to clean any apartments at 301 until Wednesday afternoon."
  >
  > Earlier from Merwin: "**Leo is picking up the suburban from Teterboro after he clean Ehud's apt as per JE** as dad is in Florida. I also need Leo to clean 9 East Tuesday if JE is coming back on Wednesday as **Sonam was given days off by Karyna** until Thursday"
  >
  > Original from JE: "**Reminder: clean Ehud's apt at 11am and clean 2G**"

- **Analysis:** This single email chain establishes:
  1. Epstein personally ("as per JE") directed staff to clean "Ehud's apt" at 301 E. 66th Street
  2. "Les" = Lesley Groff (Epstein's executive assistant)
  3. The same staff member (Leo) cleaned both Ehud's apartment and 9 East 71st Street (Epstein's mansion)
  4. "Karyna" = Karyna Shuliak (Epstein's girlfriend) had authority over household staff
  5. Apartment 2G was a guest apartment ("guest arriving for 2G on Friday")
  6. The suburban was being picked up from Teterboro (private jet airport)
  7. This email is dated March 4, 2019 -- just 4 months before Epstein's arrest

On a single day, Epstein's schedule lists:
- **Ehud Barak** -- Former Israeli PM

# PART II: NICOLE JUNKERMANN -- COMPLETE DOCUMENT ANALYSIS

## Total Documents: 10+ confirmed across all document collections

Nicole Junkermann is a German-born investor, founder of NJF Holdings, and has been publicly reported to have invested in Carbyne (the emergency technology company chaired by Ehud Barak). The FBI files document a 10-year relationship with Epstein from 2009 to 2019.

## A. The Original Correspondence (2011 Calendar Entries)

### [EFTA01775214](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01775214.pdf) -- Email FROM Junkermann (October 5, 2011)
- **Redaction content:** "On Oct 5, 2011, at 6:14 PM, Nicole Junkermann [...]"
- **Nature:** An email sent from Junkermann to Epstein or his staff. Body is redacted.

- **Redaction content:** "On Tue Apr 19, 2011 at 9:47 AM, Nicole Junkermann [...]"

### [EFTA01796749](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01796749.pdf) -- Email FROM Junkermann (May 11, 2011)
- **Redaction content:** "On May 11, 2011, at 5:47 PM, Nicole Junkermann [...]"

### [EFTA01883804](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01883804.pdf) -- Calendar Entry + Question Marks (Undated)
- **Redaction content:** "3:00 Apt w/Nicole Junkermann" / "Nicole Junkermann??:" / "Alberto Pinto:"
- **Analysis:** The double question marks ("??") are notable -- someone on Epstein's staff is questioning Junkermann's identity or the nature of the appointment. Alberto Pinto was a French interior designer (died 2012) known for luxury yacht and residence interiors.

### [EFTA01833254](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01833254.pdf) -- Subject: "Jeffrey Epstein" FROM Junkermann (Undated, likely 2011)
- **Redaction content:** "[date] 16:32:27 +0100 / Junkermann / Subject: Jeffrey Epstein"
- **Analysis:** An email from Junkermann with "Jeffrey Epstein" as the subject line. The +0100 timezone indicates it was sent from Europe (CET). The content is fully redacted.

## B. The Leon Black Introduction (2009)

### [EFTA02435071](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02435071.pdf) -- Epstein Brokers Junkermann-Leon Black Meeting (October-November 2009)
- **Full OCR content (two email threads on the same EFTA):**

  **Thread 1 (Oct 19, 2009):**
  > "De: Jeffrey Epstein [mailto:jeevacation@gmail.com]"
  > "A: junkermann"
  > "**I spoke to Leon Black, as you know I am not intimately familiar with the complexities of private equity... He said he will take you to lunch or dinner, and be any help he can**"

  **Thread 2 (Nov 6-8, 2009):**
  > From Junkermann: "How are you? The process is advancing slowly now after a meeting btw the lawyers, mld wants to have a meeting with the lawyers and me. I remember your words and you said I should avoid her to meet and I think you are right as it will be far too emotional and now she can deal with the lawyers."
  >
  > Epstein: "**tell them you would be happy to meet, after the negotiations with the lawyers are near an end. It would be nice to have this behind you. do not meet .... until at least a year from his passing**"
  >
  > Junkermann: "will do - and YOU?"

- **Analysis:** Two separate functions visible:
  1. Epstein acting as an **investment broker**, introducing Junkermann to Leon Black (Apollo Global Management, who would pay Epstein $168M+)
  2. Epstein acting as a **personal advisor** to Junkermann on what appears to be an emotional legal matter, possibly an inheritance dispute ("negotiations with the lawyers," "a year from his passing")

## C. The Business Relationship (2016-2018)

### [EFTA02664994](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02664994.pdf) -- Auctionata/Paddles Discussion (December 29, 2016)
- **Full OCR content:**
  > From Junkermann: "Interesting situation around this company would you like to hear more or not interested?"
  > Epstein: **"always interested in anything you are"**

- **Nature:** Junkermann pitching Epstein on Auctionata (an online auction house that went bankrupt in 2017). Epstein's response is casually intimate.

### [EFTA02513966](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02513966.pdf) -- "Can u speak?" (March 8, 2018)
- **Full OCR content:**
  > "Nicole Junkermann | Junkermanngroup / Thursday, March 8, 2018 12:44 PM / Jeffrey E. / **Can u speak?**"

- **Nature:** A brief, informal message from Junkermann to Epstein's email requesting a call. The informality suggests a close ongoing relationship.

## D. The January 2019 Island Trip -- 5 Months Before Arrest

### [EFTA02273951](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02273951.pdf) -- Island Guest List with Junkermann (January 14, 2019)
- **Full OCR content:**
  > "Jeffrey Epstein [jeevacation@gmail.com] / Mon 1/14/2019 7:34:21 PM / Subject: Re: 3BIS want to go to island Feb. 2-5"
  >
  > "you would like me to tell the below you will be in Paris Jan. 22-31? can contact:"
  >
  > **"Sultan Bin Sulayem / Eduardo Teodorani / Nicole Junkermann / Jabor Yousuf"**
  >
  > "I do not have contact details for: Moritx / Bannon / Astrid / Annas"
  >
  > Original message: **"3BIS want to go to the island Feb. 2-5... we have not purchased them tickets. They are hoping they can fly to NY and then fly with you to the island."**

- **Analysis:** This document is extraordinary for multiple reasons:
  1. **Active as of January 2019** -- just 6 months before Epstein's arrest
  2. **Junkermann** is on the contact list alongside **Steve Bannon** and **Sultan Bin Sulayem** (chairman of DP World, connected to Dubai's ruling family)
  3. "3BIS" is an entity/group wanting to visit Epstein's island
  4. The email mentions Paris travel (Jan 22-31) and island travel (Feb 2-5)
  5. **Sultan bin Sulayem** separately appears in [DUBAI_SULAYEM_INVESTIGATION.md](/individuals/DUBAI_SULAYEM_INVESTIGATION.md) directing his DP World executive to contact Epstein's USVI attorney about the "port of St Croix"

# PART III: THE "COLLABORATING WITH INTELLIGENCE AGENCIES" DOCUMENTS

## [EFTA01652971](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01652971.pdf) / [EFTA01652995](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01652995.pdf) / [EFTA01653016](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01653016.pdf) / [EFTA01653060](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01653060.pdf)

### What These Documents Actually Are

These four EFTA numbers contain the SAME collection of social media screenshots gathered by the FBI, primarily from accounts associated with **George B. Tonks** and **Lady Victoria Hervey** on Twitter/X and Instagram. The intelligence agencies quote appears as a screenshot of an Instagram or social media message:

> **"If we are collaborating with intelligence agencies they are hardly going to listen to you Maria"**

This quote appears:
- [EFTA01652971](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01652971.pdf), page 15
- [EFTA01652995](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01652995.pdf), page 6
- [EFTA01653016](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01653016.pdf), page 4
- [EFTA01653060](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01653060.pdf), page 18

### Context of the Quote

The full context is a social media argument between:
- **George B. Tonks** -- who claims Maria Farmer and Virginia Giuffre are "liars" and "con artists"
- **Lady Victoria Hervey** -- who communicates with Ghislaine Maxwell and posts about "the Extortion Criminal Ring"
- **Maria Farmer** -- Epstein victim and FBI witness
- **Sarah Ransome** -- Epstein victim
- **Rebecca Cohen** -- anti-abuse advocate

The "intelligence agencies" quote is one person's statement IN a social media argument, addressed to Maria Farmer. It is NOT an FBI investigative finding, NOT a government document, and NOT a confirmed statement of fact. The person saying it appears to be claiming that unnamed intelligence agencies are collaborating with the anti-Giuffre/Farmer camp led by Tonks.

### The Full Social Media Collection Also Contains:

- [EFTA01652757](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01652757.pdf): A Tonks post listing: "Donald J. Trump, Prince Andrew, Alan Dershowitz, Lady Victoria Hervey, Leslie & Abigail Wexner, George B. Tonks, Eileen Guggenheim, Glenn & Eva Dubin, Richard Branson, the Maxwell's, **FBI, MI6, CIA or Mossad DID NOT KILL [Epstein]** / **[Virginia Giuffre] KILLED [Epstein]**"

- Multiple posts where Tonks claims to have communicated with Lady Victoria Hervey, who he says "communicates with Ghislaine" behind the scenes.

### Assessment

These documents are FBI-collected social media evidence, likely gathered because they relate to witness intimidation and tampering against Maria Farmer and Virginia Giuffre. The intelligence agencies reference is a third-party social media claim, not an investigative finding. However, the FBI's decision to collect and preserve these screenshots indicates they were considered relevant to the case, possibly as evidence of a coordinated campaign to discredit victims.

# PART IV: THE ALLEN/OREN/TAL VICTIM ACCOUNT

## [EFTA01660651](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01660651.pdf) / [EFTA01660679](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01660679.pdf) -- NTOC Tips Compilation

### Full Text of the Relevant Tip:

> "At age 16, while modeling, caller attended 8 parties at Epstein's New York residence. On one occasion, caller reported she was sexually assaulted by Epstein. On another occasion, **two twin brothers, Allen and Oren, lured caller and her friend upstairs but they escaped back downstairs. Caller stated Oren raped her best friend and a third brother, Tal, raped a 14 year old girl named Katie LNU.** Caller named other individuals involved in 'big orgy parties' with her, other young girls, and older Victoria's Secret models, including Bill Clinton and Donald Trump."

### FBI's Own Annotation (from page 3):

> "Allen, Oren, Tal (LNU, **possibly identifiable as Alexander brothers**)"

### Analysis:

1. **The names Allen, Oren, and Tal are Hebrew/Israeli in origin.** Oren and Tal are distinctly Israeli first names. The FBI's annotation "possibly identifiable as Alexander brothers" suggests investigators attempted to identify these individuals.

2. **The victim reports 8 separate parties** at Epstein's New York residence while she was 16 and modeling, indicating serial access to minors through the modeling industry.

3. **Three separate sexual assaults are described:** Epstein sexually assaulted the caller; Oren raped her best friend; Tal raped a 14-year-old named Katie.

4. **Victoria's Secret models** are explicitly mentioned as present at these parties alongside "young girls," placing models and young girls at the same events where sexual abuse occurred.

5. **The "Alexander brothers" annotation** has never been publicly resolved. No charges against individuals by these names appear in the case record.

6. **The document also identifies** the caller's claim of "big orgy parties" involving Bill Clinton and Donald Trump at the same events.

### Other Tips in the Same Compilation:

The [EFTA01660651](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01660651.pdf)/679 documents contain 16+ separate NTOC tips. Other notable entries include:
- A victim reporting she was "forced to perform oral sex on President Trump approximately 35 years ago in NJ" at age 13-14
- A personal assistant to Epstein from 1986-1991 who named "Bill Clinton and Donald Trump" as party guests
- A tip about sex trafficking at "the Trump Golf Course in Rancho Palos Verdes, CA between 1995-1996"
- Multiple tips deemed "not credible" with "mandatory psychiatric evaluations" noted

# PART V: ISRAELI GEOGRAPHIC AND MILITARY CONNECTIONS

## A. Epstein's 2008 Military Base Tour

### [EFTA00013730](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00013730.pdf) -- "Just Visiting" Press Clipping (April 25, 2008)
- **Full OCR content:**
  > "Just received a call from [redacted]. One of Epstein's private investigators, Robert Myers, has been trying to track down one of our victims for several days and finally caught up with her today. She told him that she did not want to talk to him and he then told her that, **if she wouldn't talk to him, her name would somehow appear in the press** and she should think about how that will affect her."
  >
  > "JEFFREY Epstein -- who's facing jail time for soliciting prostitutes, some of whom were under the age of 18 -- isn't feeling the love stateside, so he's skipped the country (temporarily, we're assured) to feel the love in Israel. A rep said Epstein, who was spotted at the Tel Aviv Hilton over the weekend, **'is in Israel for Passover. He's meeting with Israeli scientists about medical research he's funding and taking a tour of military bases with [Friends of Israel chairman] Benny Shabtai.'**"
  >
  > "As for his ongoing legal troubles, the rep added, **'It should be noted that the alleged victims have all acknowledged they lied about their age.'**"

- **Critical context:** This AUSA email documents TWO things simultaneously:
  1. Epstein's PI was actively intimidating victims (threatening press exposure)
  2. Epstein was touring Israeli military bases WHILE UNDER CRIMINAL INDICTMENT
  3. His representative attacked the victims publicly while he traveled freely

### [EFTA02148317](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA02148317.pdf) / [EFTA02148337](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA02148337.pdf) -- Benny Shabtai Coming (Undated)
- **Redaction content:** "have any info re Benny Shabtai coming" (appears twice)
- **Nature:** Staff inquiry about Shabtai visiting Epstein, confirming an ongoing relationship with the "Friends of Israel" chairman.

### [EFTA02175707](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA02175707.pdf) -- Shabtai Reference
- **Redaction content:** "Shabtai"
- **Nature:** Additional reference to Shabtai in Epstein's communications.

## B. IDF-Branded Clothing and Military Uniform on Little Saint James Island

### [EFTA00001970](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%201/EFTA00001970.pdf) -- IDF Sweatshirt (Image Analysis Database)
> "The text on the sweatshirt reads 'IDF' (Israel Defense Forces) and includes some additional text in a language that appears to be Hebrew."
> Found in "a wooden wardrobe with shelves and a drawer" alongside "folded sweatshirts in various colors."

### [EFTA00001971](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%201/EFTA00001971.pdf) -- IDF T-Shirt with Hebrew Text
> "'ISRAEL DEFENSE FORCES' and 'tzahal' (Hebrew for 'Israel Defense Forces') are printed on the shirt."

### [EFTA00001969](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%201/EFTA00001969.pdf) -- White Military Dress Uniform with Medals
> "A white military uniform with several medals and ribbons pinned to the chest area... indicating a history of service and achievement."

**Assessment:** Two items ([EFTA00001970](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%201/EFTA00001970.pdf), [EFTA00001971](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%201/EFTA00001971.pdf)) are clearly IDF-branded, with visible "IDF" logos and Hebrew text reading "צה"ל." The white dress uniform ([EFTA00001969](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%201/EFTA00001969.pdf)) bears no visible national insignia or markings that would identify its country of origin; it has not been identified as IDF and its provenance is unknown. Medals are issued for actual military service, not sold as souvenirs. The owners of these items are not established in the FBI files -- possible owners include Ehud Barak (who maintained an apartment in Epstein's building) or another visitor, but this is unverified.

## C. Jacqui Safra's Jerusalem Residence

### [EFTA01750543](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01750543.pdf) / [EFTA01933564](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01933564.pdf) -- Jerusalem Property Negotiation
- **[EFTA01750543](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01750543.pdf):** March 24, 2014 — Lesley Groff forwarding John Brockman email to Epstein. Subject: "Jacqui's Jerusalem residence." Brockman's message explicitly names **"Jacqui Safra"** and provides his phone number. References a conversation at the March 17, 2014 Edge Foundation "Billionaires' Dinner" in Vancouver: "Jacqui wants to know if you would like to have a serious conversation about his Jerusalem residence that he discussed with you Monday night."
- **[EFTA01933564](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01933564.pdf):** Epstein's reply: "yes, and Paul Allen" — confirming interest and requesting parallel outreach to Paul Allen (Microsoft co-founder, also present at the Vancouver dinner).
- **Earlier pitch:** [EFTA00394883](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00394883.pdf) (Feb 26, 2013) — Brockman to Epstein: "Jacqui Safra is here with me. Wants to sell you his Jerusalem house in Talbieh neighborhood known as 'The Sherover House' across st from Jerusalem Theatre."

- **Identification:** Jacob "Jacqui" Eli Safra (b. 1947), Swiss billionaire (~$5B), member of the Safra banking dynasty, owner of Encyclopaedia Britannica and Spring Mountain Vineyards. Safra acquired the Sherover property on Dubnov Street in the **Talbieh** neighborhood of Jerusalem in 1991 and expanded it in 2004. The property is across from the Jerusalem Theatre (built and donated by the Sherover family). Full investigation: [JACQUI_SAFRA_INVESTIGATION](/individuals/JACQUI_SAFRA_INVESTIGATION.md).

- **Israel Relevance Assessment:** The Safra-Epstein connection is **social/financial**, not intelligence-related. Safra was part of Epstein's Edge Foundation dinner circuit alongside tech billionaires. The Jerusalem property discussion reflects Epstein's interest in Israeli real estate but does not connect to intelligence infrastructure. No evidence suggests the property sale was completed. Epstein separately stated: "I would not do biz with the safras, under any circumstances" ([EFTA02468988](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02468988.pdf)).

## D. "Military Edge in the Middle East" / "Possibility of Israel"

### [EFTA01982248](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01982248.pdf) -- Israel/Military Reference (Undated)
- **Redaction content (V2):** "qualitative military edge in the Middle East C" / "ns an t c possibility of Israel octet g t c u"
- **Redaction content (DS10):** Same text fragments

- **Analysis:** The phrase "qualitative military edge in the Middle East" is standard US policy language referring to America's commitment to maintaining Israel's Qualitative Military Edge (QME) over regional adversaries. This appears to be from a policy document or news article, possibly related to the Obama-Goldberg interview ([EFTA02406470](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02406470.pdf)) which discusses Israeli security in detail.

### [EFTA02406470](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02406470.pdf) -- Obama-Goldberg Interview on Israel/Iran (Context Document)
- **Full OCR content (72KB):** This is an extensive document containing President Obama's interview with Jeffrey Goldberg of The Atlantic about Iran nuclear negotiations, Syria's chemical weapons, and Israel's security. Key excerpts:

  > "In addition to the profound threat that it poses to Israel, one of our strongest allies in the world; in addition to the outrageous language that has been directed toward Israel by the leaders of the Iranian government -- if Iran gets a nuclear weapon, this would run completely contrary to my policies of nonproliferation."

- **Assessment:** This appears to be a policy article forwarded within Epstein's network, suggesting interest in US-Israel strategic relations. It is NOT a personal communication about intelligence operations.

# PART VI: THE ACOSTA "INTELLIGENCE ASSET" QUESTION

## A. The Daily Beast Report in FBI Files

### [EFTA00030182](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00030182.pdf) -- "I was told Epstein 'belonged to intelligence'"
- **Full OCR content:**
  > "Subject: transition / Date: Wed, 10 Jul 2019 02:02:06 +0000"
  >
  > "'Is the Epstein case going to cause a problem [for confirmation hearings]?' Acosta had been asked. Acosta had explained, breezily, apparently, that back in the day he'd had just one meeting on the Epstein case. He'd cut the non-prosecution deal with one of Epstein's attorneys because he had 'been told' to back off, that Epstein was above his pay grade. **'I was told Epstein "belonged to intelligence" and to leave it alone,'** he told his interviewers in the Trump transition, who evidently thought that was a sufficient answer and went ahead and hired Acosta."

- **Source:** This is a Daily Beast article (by Vicky Ward, July 2019) forwarded by an AUSA at SDNY. The article reports Acosta's statement during Trump transition vetting.
- **Significance:** This was circulated internally at SDNY just days after Epstein's July 2019 arrest, indicating prosecutors were aware of the intelligence claims.

## B. Acosta's Sworn Denial ([EFTA00009116](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%207/EFTA00009116.pdf))

Under oath in his deposition, Acosta said:
> "I'm not aware of it."
> "Not to my recollection."
> "There are questions that I may be asked publicly, that I don't think it's right for me to comment as to what classified information I may or may not know, because that's not the kind of stuff you'd go into, but the answer is no, and no."

**Analysis:** Acosta's denial is notable for its qualifications:
- "Not aware" rather than "it didn't happen"
- "Not to my recollection" rather than "no one said that"
- Explicitly acknowledges classified information constraints
- His deposition denial contradicts the transition-vetting account reported by the Daily Beast

## C. FOIA Exemption for Foreign Government Relations ([EFTA00015219](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00015219.pdf))

The FBI's FOIA deliberative process memo, applied to withhold Epstein-related information:
> "The release of official United States Government documents that reveal the existence of a confidential relationship with a foreign government reasonably could be expected to strain relations between the United States and the foreign government."

**Assessment:** This exemption was used to withhold information from public release. It does not specify which foreign government, but its application to Epstein files implies the existence of documents touching on foreign government relationships that the FBI considers sensitive enough to withhold.

# PART VII: THE MELVYN KOHN CORRESPONDENCE -- THE FULL TEXT

## [EFTA00037218](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00037218.pdf) / [EFTA00037239](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00037239.pdf) -- Letters to Mark Epstein (August 2019)

Between August 12-19, 2019 — beginning two days after Jeffrey Epstein's death on August 10 — a man identifying himself as Melvyn Kohn sent unsolicited emails to Mark Epstein (Jeffrey's brother). Mark Epstein forwarded these to his attorney Stacey Richman, who forwarded them to SDNY. Kohn's claimed intelligence background (see below) is self-reported and unverified in these files.

### Kohn's Self-Identification:
> "Without narrowing down my identity too much, I can tell you that **I was in US military intel and had a clearance issued to me young, when my uncle was in fact head of int'l relations at the Pentagon and answered directly to the president.** Other family members hold TS+ and I might ask one to be a liaison."

### On Mossad Allegations:
> "No surprise to you I am sure that many are rushing to say that he, and you and sometimes even all of us are Mossad. And I take into account that many of the accusations against him are false, some conflated."
>
> "You have some things here. You have information, which you may not know the value of, **as far as it shows that neither you nor he are Mossad, or even working knowingly for any foreign intel agency.**"
>
> "But **there is the presence of certain parties in this mix who ARE**, including on the Humpty Dumpty charity, which you and he were part of, along with 29 Congressmen."

### On Arms Dealers and Foreign Agents:
> "Years ago **Jeffrey had some exposure to North Korean/Chinese agents, and was in the proximity of arms dealers who sold to these nations and on behalf of them.**"
>
> "**Gerald Bull** may have been involved, after being stripped of his US citizenship. And possibly **Dr. Herman Erben**. That would have been in Europe, 70s/80s."

**Gerald Bull** was a Canadian weapons designer who built a supergun for Saddam Hussein and was assassinated in Brussels in 1990, widely attributed to Mossad.

**Herman Erben** was an Austrian-American physician and spy who worked for multiple intelligence services during WWII, including the Abwehr (German military intelligence). He died in 1985.

### On Mark Epstein's Security:
> "When the #1 target was a risk factor to a certain already mentioned person and their allies, you were safe. Until he was out of the equation. Now they can work down the list."
>
> "I am not sure if GM is on it or their ally, she thinks she is but allies have ways of falling out. Or falling down dark stairs, despite her power."

### Mark Epstein's Israeli Connections:
> Mark Epstein: "Do you know Jumas, from the Knesset?"
> Kohn discusses Knesset members including "Haim Oron" and "Sharon Haskell, the Likud member."

### Source Credibility Assessment:

Kohn's letters are the only correspondence in the FBI files from a self-identified intelligence professional specifically addressing the Mossad question. However, significant credibility caveats apply:

- **Unverified identity**: Kohn's claimed intelligence background ("US military intel," uncle "head of int'l relations at the Pentagon") is self-reported. No verification exists in these files or in public records.
- **Timing**: The correspondence began 2 days after Jeffrey Epstein's death and lasted approximately one week — consistent with an unsolicited tipster inserting himself into a high-profile event.
- **Professional assessment**: T&M Protection Resources (the Epstein family's private security firm) conducted an email header analysis tracing Kohn's emails to UK-based Yahoo servers ([EFTA00146777](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00146777.pdf), [EFTA00037242](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00037242.pdf)) and classified the correspondence as "emails harassing mark epstein" ([EFTA00037236](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00037236.pdf)).
- **FBI non-response**: The FBI received the letters through two channels and met with T&M on August 20, 2019 ([EFTA00037232](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00037232.pdf)). No FD-302 interview, case serial assignment, or documented investigative follow-up exists.
- **Own walkback**: Kohn acknowledged the Gerald Bull and Herman Erben references were speculative: "I was clutching at straws, almost certain you would not have heard of them" ([EFTA00037218](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00037218.pdf) p.1).
- **Verifiable knowledge**: Kohn correctly identified real Israeli Knesset members (Sharren Haskel/Likud, Haim Oron/Meretz) and their specific legislative activities, and his reference to Mark Epstein's involvement with the Humpty Dumpty Institute is confirmed by Mark's own emails ([EFTA01929259](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01929259.pdf), [EFTA02598877](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02598877.pdf)).

Kohn's core claim — that Epstein was NOT Mossad but "certain parties in this mix" WERE connected to foreign intelligence — is an assertion from an unverified source. He does not identify which parties or which intelligence service.

# PART VIII: THE WEXNER-ISRAEL AXIS

## A. The Financial Genesis

### [EFTA02731082](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2012/EFTA02731082.pdf) -- Wexner Attorney Proffer to SDNY (July 25, 2019)

Wexner's counsel revealed:
- The 9 East 71st Street townhouse "belonged to Wexner, but the Wexners had moved out of it in 1995."
- "Epstein also sold himself a private plane that previously belonged to Wexner at a deeply discounted price."
- "Wexner learned that **Epstein had stolen or otherwise misappropriated several hundred million dollars** from Wexner."
- "Epstein said he was being **blackmailed** and it could get messy."
- Epstein had power of attorney over Wexner's finances.

> "Epstein provided initial financing to Wexner's YLK Charitable Fund more than 10 years ago... Epstein in 2008 from essentially bankrolling one of Wexner's first nonprofit foundations with a contribution of more than $40 million in stock and other assets."

## B. Mega Group: ZERO Results (Confirmed)

Exhaustive searches across all document collections for "Mega Group" return ZERO results. This is confirmed as of February 8, 2026 with fresh queries to:
- primary document text database: 0 results
- OCR text extraction database: 0 results

The Mega Group -- co-founded by Leslie Wexner and Charles Bronfman in 1991 as a study group of Jewish billionaires focused on Jewish philanthropy and Israel advocacy -- is entirely absent from the FBI's Epstein investigative files. This is a notable negative finding.

## C. Wexner-Israel Implicit Connections

While no Wexner-Israel explicit documents exist, the following circumstantial links are documented:
1. Wexner's power of attorney granted Epstein access to "several hundred million dollars" -- the financial genesis of Epstein's entire operation
2. Epstein claimed to be managing money for "a sultan in Dubai" and "Prince Andrew" -- both groups he also procured victims for
3. MC2 Model Management advertised recruitment of girls "ages 13-20" -- the same agency housed models at 301 E. 66th Street where Barak had an apartment
4. The Prominent Names briefing links Wexner to Epstein's blackmail operation via victim testimony

# PART IX: CARBYNE, BEN-MENASHE, AND REPORTY -- NEGATIVE FINDINGS

## Fresh Searches Conducted February 8, 2026:

| Search Term | Database | Results |
|-------------|----------|---------|
| "CARBYNE" | primary document text database | **ZERO** |
| "Reporty" | primary document text database | **ZERO** |
| "Ari Ben" | primary document text database | **ZERO** |
| "Ben-Menashe" | primary document text database | **ZERO** |
| "Mega Group" | primary document text database | **ZERO** |
| "Mega Group" | OCR text extraction database | **ZERO** |
| "Wexner" + "Israel" | primary document text database | **ZERO** |

### Assessment:

**Carbyne** (formerly Reporty Homeland Security) is the emergency call-handling technology company that Ehud Barak chaired and Nicole Junkermann invested in through NJF Holdings. Despite extensive public reporting linking Carbyne to Epstein's funding, the term does not appear anywhere in the 218GB FBI corpus.

**Ari Ben-Menashe** is a former Israeli military intelligence officer who publicly claimed Epstein was recruited by Israeli intelligence. His name does not appear in any FBI document.

This complete absence could mean:
1. The FBI never investigated these connections
2. Relevant documents were classified and withheld from FOIA release
3. These connections were investigated under different case serials not included in this corpus
4. The public claims are not corroborated by the FBI's investigative findings

# PART X: THE BLACKMAIL INFRASTRUCTURE AND ITS INTELLIGENCE IMPLICATIONS

## A. Documented Blackmail Purpose

### [EFTA00021553](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00021553.pdf) -- Jane Doe #3 Filing (January 2, 2015)
> "Epstein also trafficked Jane Doe #3 for sexual purposes to many other powerful men, including numerous prominent American politicians, powerful business executives, foreign presidents, a well-known Prime Minister, and other world leaders. **Epstein required Jane Doe #3 to describe the events that she had with these men so that he could potentially blackmail them.**"

### [EFTA01731006](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01731006.pdf) -- FBI Blackmail Case File (Serial 31E-MM-108062)
> "attempting to blackmail powerful businessmen in New York"
> "STEIN offers to provide contacts, presumably for..."
> "STEIN suggests names of individuals..."

### [EFTA00024032](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00024032.pdf) -- 2006 Lawsuit Allegation
> "Papers filed in a 2006 lawsuit alleged that **Epstein surreptitiously recorded sexual activity between prominent individuals and underage girls for purposes of blackmail**"

### [EFTA02731226](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2012/EFTA02731226.pdf) -- Maxwell Prosecution Memo
> Victim "stated that Epstein had cameras in his clocks"

### [EFTA00029761](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00029761.pdf) -- Palm Beach Police (2003)
> Epstein was "purchasing cameras, concealing in clocks, monitoring on computer"

## B. The Relevance to Intelligence Theories

The blackmail infrastructure is well-documented:
- Victims were **required** to describe encounters with powerful men
- **Hidden cameras** were installed in clocks and confirmed by Palm Beach police
- An FBI case file documents investigation into **"blackmail of powerful businessmen"**
- A 2006 lawsuit alleged **surreptitious recording** of sexual activity for blackmail

This infrastructure is consistent with -- but does not prove -- an intelligence operation. What the files do NOT show is:
- Who received the intelligence product
- Whether any intelligence service directed the operation
- Whether the blackmail was for personal financial gain, intelligence purposes, or both
- The destination of any recordings or compromising information

# PART XI: THE DILORIO/SCHLAFF ISRAELI FINANCIAL THREAD

### [EFTA00010724](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00010724.pdf) / [EFTA00010786](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00010786.pdf) / [EFTA00010819](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00010819.pdf) -- Dilorio Whistleblower Materials

Christopher Dilorio's FBI filings connect Epstein to Israeli financial networks:

> "Alpha Capital: **Martin Schlaff**: MY CLAIMS / Ladenburg/Gruntal: Refco/Bawag"
> "Schlaff AND: Englander/Nordlicht/Kushners"
> "Epstein: Schwarzman / Epstein: Black / Black/Schwarzman: Kushner"
> "Martin Schlaff/Balmore/Alpha Cap: haaretz.com/israel-news..."
> "**Martin Schlaff: Bag Man**"
> "Stetson: Honig side kick. Therapix now SciSparc. Still Israel... 20 Raul Wallenberg Street, Tower A, **Tel Aviv 6971916, Israel**"
> "Aegis 'Investment banking' has ties to Israeli military"
> "Isaac Livni-EIDE: related?"

**Martin Schlaff** is an Austrian-Israeli billionaire investigated for corruption in Israeli politics, particularly payments to Ariel Sharon's son. Dilorio alleges Schlaff's Alpha Capital Anstalt (Liechtenstein) was connected to money laundering networks intersecting Epstein's financial operations.

---

# PART XII: COMPLETE ASSESSMENT

## What the Evidence Establishes:

1. **Ehud Barak's relationship with Epstein was extensive and deeply integrated.** 25+ documents confirm a 9-year relationship (2010-2019) including: an apartment cleaned by Epstein's staff in a building that also housed MC2 models and trafficking victims, direct email correspondence, routinized scheduling through his assistant Nili Priel, lunches with Joel Klein and Mort Zuckerman, a brokered Bannon meeting, and presence on a single-day calendar alongside Leon Black, Larry Summers, and Peter Thiel. This is not a casual acquaintance -- the documents show a former head of state with sustained personal, logistical, and financial ties to Epstein across the period when trafficking was ongoing. No document links Barak to awareness of or participation in the trafficking itself.

2. **Nicole Junkermann maintained a 10-year business and personal relationship with Epstein (2009-2019).** Epstein brokered her introduction to Leon Black, advised her on personal legal matters, discussed investment opportunities, and included her on a January 2019 island trip guest list alongside Steve Bannon and Sultan bin Sulayem. Her relationship was active through at least March 2018 ("Can u speak?") and January 2019.

3. **Epstein had access to Israeli military installations** during his criminal proceedings (2008 Passover visit), toured military bases with the chairman of "Friends of Israel," and had IDF-branded clothing (sweatshirt and T-shirt) plus a white military dress uniform with medals (national origin unidentified) on his private island.

4. **Alexander Acosta told Trump transition interviewers** that he was "told Epstein 'belonged to intelligence' and to leave it alone." Under oath, he denied this but with notable qualifications about classified information.

5. **The blackmail infrastructure is well-documented** -- hidden cameras, required debriefs from victims, FBI case file on "blackmail of powerful businessmen," surreptitious recording allegations -- but its ultimate beneficiary is not identified in the files.

6. **The "intelligence agencies" quote** is from a social media post collected by the FBI, NOT from any investigative finding or government document.

7. **The Allen/Oren/Tal victim account** describes rapes by three brothers with Hebrew/Israeli names at Epstein's New York parties, annotated by the FBI as "possibly identifiable as Alexander brothers." This was never resolved in the case record.

## What the Evidence Does NOT Establish:

1. **An FBI CHS FD-1023 document does contain intelligence claims.** [EFTA00090314](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00090314.pdf) is a 3-page FBI Confidential Human Source reporting document in which a source relays that Dershowitz told Acosta "Epstein belonged to both U.S. and allied intelligence services" and that Epstein "trained as a spy under" Barak. While FD-1023 forms document unverified CHS claims (not FBI conclusions), the original report's statement that "No document in the FBI files states that Epstein was an intelligence asset" was incorrect -- this document exists in the FBI case file. Additionally, an investigative memo ([EFTA00098755](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00098755.pdf), page 4) states: "Jeffrey Epstein worked for the United States government as a financial bounty hunter."

2. **Israeli intelligence service references exist in the email corpus**, though they appear to originate from news articles and Wikipedia content forwarded within email chains. Unit 8200 yields 11 documents (8 DS9 + 3 DS10); Shin Bet yields 23 documents (12 DS9 + 6 DS10 + 5 DS11). Mossad yields 96 DS9 documents, the most significant being the CHS FD-1023 noted above. These do not appear to represent operational intelligence connections in most cases but the categorical "ZERO" was incorrect. **LAKAM** remains genuinely absent.

3. **Carbyne and Reporty are extensively documented in the email corpus.** The original report stated these were "completely absent from the 218GB corpus." The full email corpus reveals 50 Carbyne documents and 324 Reporty documents, including complete investment structures, board reports forwarded by Barak to Epstein, CEO correspondence from Amir Elichai (57 docs), and legal documentation. **Mega Group** yields 4 documents (likely Wikipedia/news false positives). **Ben-Menashe** remains confirmed at ZERO.

4. **The provenance of the IDF-branded clothing and military uniform** on Little Saint James is never explained.

5. **The destination of blackmail intelligence** (if any) is never identified.

6. **MC2's Tel Aviv recruiting operations** are not investigated in any FBI document despite MC2 publicly advertising recruitment of girls ages 13-20.

## The Gap Between Public Narrative and FBI Files (Revised Assessment):

The public narrative connecting Epstein to Israeli intelligence relies heavily on:
- Ari Ben-Menashe's claims (ABSENT from FBI files -- confirmed ZERO across 1.38M docs)
- Carbyne/Reporty connections (**NOW DOCUMENTED**: 374 documents in the email corpus establishing Epstein as an active Carbyne investor alongside Barak and Junkermann)
- Mega Group theories (4 documents, likely Wikipedia/news references -- no operational connection)
- Robert Maxwell's Mossad history (NOT referenced in FBI investigative documents)

What the FBI files DO contain is extensive documentation of:
- Barak's physical integration into Epstein's infrastructure (3,756 documents total)
- Epstein's direct Carbyne/Reporty investments with Barak ($500K personal investment, $50M valuation, board-level reporting)
- Epstein's access to Israeli military facilities
- IDF-branded clothing and unidentified military uniform on Epstein's island
- The blackmail infrastructure (cameras, required debriefs, FBI case file)
- The Acosta "intelligence" account AND the FBI CHS FD-1023 ([EFTA00090314](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00090314.pdf)) containing source claims of intelligence service connections
- The investigative memo ([EFTA00098755](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00098755.pdf)) characterizing Epstein as a "financial bounty hunter" for the U.S. government
- The Kohn letters (unverified source, see Part VII credibility assessment) claiming "certain parties in this mix" ARE intelligence-connected
- FOIA exemptions for "confidential relationship with a foreign government"
- Masha Drokova identified by FBI ARMS investigation as "Putin's kiss, former publicist for Jeffrey Epstein" with regular 2017 meetings and Russian technology transfer concerns ([EFTA00129096](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00129096.pdf))

The original report's conclusion that "the infrastructure is consistent with an intelligence operation but no explicit service connection is identified" requires revision. The FBI CHS report explicitly claims Epstein belonged to intelligence services. The Carbyne investment chain demonstrates direct financial connections between Epstein, Barak, and Junkermann in an Israeli emergency-services technology company whose founders had Unit 8200 backgrounds. The "financial bounty hunter" memo characterizes Epstein as a government operative. While none of these documents constitute proof of an intelligence relationship (CHS claims are unverified, memos may be speculative), they represent exactly the kind of explicit claims the original report said did not exist in the files.

# PART VII: FULL CORPUS EXPANSION -- CARBYNE/REPORTY, FBI CHS INTELLIGENCE DOCUMENT, AND DROKOVA (ADDED FEB 12, 2026)

*This section documents findings from the full_text_corpus.db (1,380,937 docs across all 12 datasets) that were not available to the original Feb 8 report, which searched only the redaction and OCR databases.*

## A. Carbyne/Reporty Investment Documentation (ZERO to 374 Documents)

The original report's statement that Carbyne and Reporty were "completely absent from the 218GB corpus" has been overturned. The email corpus contains extensive Carbyne/Reporty documentation:

### Financial Structure
[EFTA01030313](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA01030313.pdf)/[EFTA01030316](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA01030316.pdf) (DS9): Junkermann-Epstein negotiation email revealing exact Carbyne financial structure:
> "Carbyne invested 1.5 m (1m you and 0.5m me) net of fees is 3.9m your share, Ehud carry 1.5 m and my share 2m"

This also discusses: "We invested 1M in carbon [Carbyne] at 8m pre. Total invested by all investors was 6m... valuation was 50m" and references Chinese investment discussions.

### Board Reports Forwarded to Epstein
[EFTA00631912](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00631912.pdf) (DS9): Barak forwarding Reporty/Carbyne monthly investor reports to Epstein: "Hag Same'ach Jeff. Looking forward for our next meeting. Best EB." The attached monthly report from Amir Elichai (Reporty CEO) includes company metrics and strategic updates, establishing Epstein as an active investor receiving board-level information.

[EFTA01013926](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA01013926.pdf) (DS9): Another Barak forward of Reporty/Carbyne reports to Epstein, confirming a regular reporting pattern.

### Barak Brokering Series B with Epstein
[EFTA01013264](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA01013264.pdf) (DS9): Barak to Junkermann regarding Carbyne Series B funding: "I propose we will discuss the issue together with JE." Barak explicitly positioning Epstein as a decision-maker in Carbyne's next funding round.

### Legal Documentation Chain
[EFTA01034903](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA01034903.pdf) (DS9): Richard Kahn (HBRK Associates) forwarding Carbyne legal documents from Darren Indyke (Epstein's attorney) to Israeli law firm partner Tomer at fwmk-law.co.il. Epstein's legal infrastructure was directly involved in Carbyne corporate governance.

### Reporty Financial Reports
[EFTA00614842](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00614842.pdf) (DS9): Reporty monthly financial highlights with bank balance details and burn rates.
[EFTA00798601](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00798601.pdf) (DS9): Full Carbyne milestone/annual report (2017-2018).
[EFTA01035810](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA01035810.pdf) (DS9): Carbyne Annual Statements 2017 and forecasts.

### Epstein Frustration (Pre-Arrest)
[EFTA01030113](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA01030113.pdf) (DS9): Epstein to Junkermann, February 2019 (5 months before arrest): "I have little idea of carbyne results to date."

## B. FBI CHS FD-1023 -- Intelligence Service Claims

[EFTA00090314](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00090314.pdf) (DS9): A 3-page FBI Confidential Human Source (CHS) reporting document (FD-1023 format) containing the following source claims:

> "Dershowitz told CHS that if he were young again, he would be holding a stun gun as an Israeli Intelligence (Mossad) agent"

> "CHS remembered Dershowitz tell Alex Acosta that Epstein belonged to both U.S. and allied intelligence services"

> "After these calls, Mossad would then call Dershowitz to debrief"

> "Epstein was close to the former Prime Minister of Israel, Ehud Barak and trained as a spy under him"

Additional claims in the same document include assertions about Leon Black owning "the mercenary firm formerly known as Blackwater, now Constellis," Masha Drokova described as "Putin's main contact in Russian Youth movement," and Chabad/Kushner references.

**Reliability note:** FD-1023 forms document CHS statements for investigation leads. The intelligence claims in this document have not been verified by the FBI -- they represent what a source reported. However, the document's existence in the Epstein case file means the FBI received and preserved these claims as part of the investigation.

## C. Investigative Memo -- "Financial Bounty Hunter"

[EFTA00098755](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00098755.pdf) (DS9, page 4): An investigative memo stating: "Jeffrey Epstein worked for the United States government as a financial bounty hunter. He has retained significant political connections with both Israel and the United States."

## D. Masha Drokova -- FBI ARMS Investigation

[EFTA00129096](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00129096.pdf) (DS9): FBI document identifying Drokova as "nicknamed 'PUTIN's kiss,' former publicist for JEFFREY EPSTEIN." Part of an FBI ARMS (Automated Record Management System) investigation connected to Day One Ventures (VC firm), Quantum Wave Fund, Runa Capital, Serguei Beloussov, and Russian technology transfer concerns.

DS9 calendar entries reveal regular Drokova meetings with Epstein throughout 2017 (May, July, September, November). A $1,790 Prada purchase was coordinated through Epstein's staff for Drokova.
