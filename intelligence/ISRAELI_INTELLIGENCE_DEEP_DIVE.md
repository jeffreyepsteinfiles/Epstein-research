# EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

This investigation systematically searched 218GB of DOJ documents across four databases for evidence connecting Jeffrey Epstein to Israeli intelligence operations, personnel, and infrastructure. The results reveal a dense web of connections between Epstein and Israeli state actors, military infrastructure, and intelligence-adjacent figures, but NO direct evidence in these FBI files that Epstein was a confirmed intelligence asset. What the documents do show is:

1. **Ehud Barak** (former Israeli PM and Defense Minister) maintained an apartment in Epstein's building at 301 E. 66th St -- the same building where MC2 models were housed and the FBI conducted a DAS search generating 2,000+ records
2. **Epstein toured Israeli military bases** during Passover 2008, while facing criminal charges, with "Friends of Israel" chairman Benny Shabtai
3. **IDF-branded clothing** (sweatshirt and T-shirt with Hebrew text) and a white military dress uniform with medals (national origin unidentified) were found on Little Saint James island
4. **Alexander Acosta** was asked at a press conference whether Epstein was "an intelligence asset" — in his OPR interview he explicitly denied it ("the answer is no, and no") but referenced classified information in the same exchange ([EFTA00009116](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%207/EFTA00009116.pdf), pages 404-405)
5. **Victim testimony** explicitly states Epstein required victims to describe sexual encounters with powerful men "so that he could potentially blackmail them"
6. **Wexner's attorney proffer** reveals Epstein stole "several hundred million dollars" and held power of attorney -- the financial genesis of Epstein's empire came from a co-founder of the Mega Group
7. ~~**ZERO results** for Carbyne, Mega Group, Shin Bet, Aman, Unit 8200, or LAKAM~~ **OVERTURNED** — Full corpus: Carbyne 50, Reporty 324, Unit 8200 11, Shin Bet 23, Mega Group 4 docs. Only Ben-Menashe, Aman, and LAKAM remain at zero. See V2 report and Part X corrections below.

> **[REVISIT UPDATE — Full Corpus Expansion]** Searching the complete 1.38M-document corpus (all 12 datasets) substantially expands several findings above. 301 E 66th Street now appears in **1,439 documents** (up from 4 in DS8 alone). **Ossa Properties LLC**, the corporate entity controlling 301 E 66th, appears in **784 documents** and was not mentioned in V1. **Paula Heil Fisher** (163 documents), absent from V1, bridges Epstein's personal life to the Israeli tech ecosystem through direct contact with Yehuda Zisapel. Blackmail references expand from 12 to **355 documents**. Additionally, an FBI CHS FD-1023 ([EFTA00090314](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00090314.pdf)) states Epstein "belonged to both U.S. and allied intelligence services" — discovered in the V2 revisit (Report #52). The V1 ZERO findings for Carbyne, Reporty, Mega Group, Unit 8200, and Shin Bet are all overturned by the V2 full-corpus search (see Part X corrections). Only Ben-Menashe and LAKAM remain at zero across the full corpus. A comprehensive V2 report exists at `ISRAEL_DEEP_DIVE_V2.md`.

# PART I: EHUD BARAK -- THE 301 EAST 66TH STREET NEXUS

## A. The Apartment Building: Three Functions Under One Roof

**[EFTA02278459](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02278459.pdf)** (Mar 4, 2019) -- THE KEY DOCUMENT

Epstein's property management email chain reveals the cleaning schedule for 301 E. 66th Street:

> "Reminder: clean Ehud's apt at 11am and clean 2G"
>
> "ok, got it, so Ehud will get cleaned today at 11am and then 2G on Wed. that is totally fine also! We have a guest arriving for 2G on Friday"
>
> "Leo is picking up the suburban from Teterboro after he clean Ehud's apt as per JE... Sonam was given days off by Karyna until Thursday"

**Analysis:** This single email chain proves:
- Epstein's staff controlled and cleaned "Ehud's apt" (Ehud Barak's apartment) at 301 E. 66th Street
- The instruction came directly from "JE" (Jeffrey Epstein)
- Apartment "2G" was a separate guest apartment in the same building
- Karyna Shuliak (Epstein's girlfriend) had authority to give Sonam (household staff) days off
- The cleaning was coordinated with Epstein's movements between Teterboro and 9 East 71st Street

**[EFTA00019513](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00019513.pdf)** (Dec 13, 2018) -- FBI INVESTIGATION OF THE BUILDING

> "could you please run database searches on 301 E. 66th Street? This is the address for a property that appears to be owned at least in part by Epstein, and where models for MC2 may have been provided housing."
>
> "Attached is the negative results for whatsapp search of phone number. Additionally I've attached a DAS search for 301 E 66 Street which contains over 2000 records."

This FBI Child Exploitation & Human Trafficking Task Force search was conducted just **3 months before** the Ehud apartment cleaning email.

**[EFTA00014526](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00014526.pdf)** (Bloomberg Investigation Summary)

> "Epstein courted young women through the Miami modeling agency MC2, putting them up in an apartment he owned on 66th Street in Manhattan a former agency bookkeeper said in a 2010 deposition in a civil case."

**[EFTA00025109](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00025109.pdf)** (Victim Filing, Nov 2019)

> "Eventually, by approximately 2004, Epstein arranged for [victim] to live in an apartment at 301 East 66th Street in Manhattan, just blocks from his townhouse"

**[EFTA00022133](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00022133.pdf)** (Victim Compilation)

> "[Victim] says Epstein arranged for her to live in an apartment at 301 E. 66th St. in 2004 -- just blocks from his Manhattan mansion."

### The Three Functions of 301 E. 66th Street:

| Unit | Function | Evidence |
|------|----------|----------|
| "Ehud's apt" | **Ehud Barak's apartment** | [EFTA02278459](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02278459.pdf) (cleaning schedule, Mar 2019) |
| Apt 2G | **Guest apartment** | [EFTA02278459](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02278459.pdf) ("guest arriving for 2G on Friday") |
| Apt 10F | **Corporate address** for Nine East 71st Street Corp / HBRK Associates | [EFTA02533859](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02533859.pdf), [EFTA00022151](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00022151.pdf), [EFTA00030236](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00030236.pdf) |
| Various units | **MC2 model housing / victim apartments** | [EFTA00019513](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00019513.pdf), [EFTA00014526](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00014526.pdf), [EFTA00025109](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00025109.pdf) |

**Karyna Shuliak's residence:** [EFTA01378419](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01378419.pdf) (redaction database) confirms "SHULIAK KARYNA / 301 E 66TH ST APT 10F" with partial SSN visible.

**[EFTA02299114](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02299114.pdf)** (Nov 2012) -- Karyna Shuliak's bags being picked up "from 301" before airport travel, confirming she lived in the building.

This means the former Prime Minister and Defense Minister of Israel maintained an apartment -- cleaned by Epstein's staff on Epstein's orders -- in the same building where:
- Trafficking victims were housed (confirmed by FBI investigation)
- MC2 models were provided apartments (confirmed by bookkeeper deposition)
- Epstein's corporate entities were registered (HBRK Associates, Suite 10F)
- Epstein's girlfriend Karyna Shuliak resided (Apt 10F / 8H)

> **[REVISIT UPDATE — 301 E 66th Street Full Corpus]** The full 1.38M-document corpus reveals **1,439 documents** referencing 301 E 66th Street (630 DS9, 647 DS10, 158 DS11), a 360x expansion from the 4 documents in DS8 alone. **Ossa Properties LLC** — the corporate entity controlling 301 E 66th — appears in **784 documents** (355 DS9, 291 DS10, 135 DS11), comparable in corpus frequency to Southern Trust or Haze Trust. This was not mentioned in V1 but is among the most frequently referenced Epstein entities in the full corpus. The building's centrality to operations is now documented at massive scale.

## B. The Full Ehud Barak Document Registry

14+ documents confirm direct Epstein-Barak contact spanning 2010-2019:

| EFTA Number | Date | Content |
|-------------|------|---------|
| [EFTA02422165](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02422165.pdf) | Sep 20, 2010 | "Jes plans to attend the Ehud Barak dinner" -- Jes Staley (JPMorgan CEO) attending dinner Epstein organized for Barak |
| [EFTA02422168](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02422168.pdf) | Sep 16, 2010 | "Tom Barrack-Ehud Barak" -- Epstein connecting Tom Barrack (Colony Capital) with Barak |
| [EFTA02406464](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02406464.pdf) | Sep 15, 2011 | Epstein asks contact: "can you do the 19th with ehud" -- arranging dinner with Barak |
| [EFTA02575361](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02575361.pdf) | Sep 21, 2013 | Epstein emails directly to "ehud barak" with Lesley Groff CC'd |
| [EFTA02589113](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02589113.pdf) | Sep 9, 2014 | Epstein to "ehud barak": "hope you are having fun" |
| [EFTA00362483](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00362483.pdf) | Sep 22, 2014 | Epstein daily schedule: "oody, Jabor, **Ehud**, Leon, Stone, Maldives, Mada" alongside "People To See: Jagland, Terje, **Thiel**, Simon, Kathy" |
| [EFTA02518862](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02518862.pdf) | Feb 28, 2018 | Nili Priel (Barak's assistant) to Epstein: "Monday Ehud is free from 10:30 AM until 3:30 PM" |
| [EFTA02633609](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02633609.pdf) | Feb 25, 2019 | Epstein to Barak (ehbarak): "steve bannon here tomorrow morning if you want to join. 930?" Barak replies: "Good idea. Done." Bannon cancels sick. |
| [EFTA02278459](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02278459.pdf) | Mar 4, 2019 | "Reminder: clean Ehud's apt at 11am" -- Epstein staff cleaning Barak's apartment at 301 E. 66th St |

### Key Relationship Findings:

1. **Barak-Staley-Epstein Triangle:** Epstein organized a dinner for Ehud Barak that Jes Staley (then JPMorgan executive) attended ([EFTA02422165](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02422165.pdf)). Staley was later accused by a victim of forced sex acts.

2. **Barak-Barrack-Epstein Triangle:** Epstein connected Tom Barrack (Colony Capital founder, later convicted of acting as UAE foreign agent) with Barak ([EFTA02422168](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02422168.pdf)).

3. **Barak-Bannon-Epstein Triangle:** Epstein attempted to broker a breakfast meeting between Barak and Steve Bannon in February 2019, just months before his arrest ([EFTA02633609](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02633609.pdf)).

4. **Barak on the September 2014 Calendar:** On a single day (Sep 22, 2014), Epstein's schedule lists Ehud Barak alongside Leon Black, Larry Summers, and Peter Thiel ([EFTA00362483](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00362483.pdf)). This is the convergence point of Israeli political, American financial, and tech worlds.

5. **Nili Priel as Intermediary:** Barak's assistant Nili Priel coordinated scheduling directly with Epstein ([EFTA02518862](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02518862.pdf)), indicating a routinized relationship.

## C. The Prominent Names Briefing -- Wexner Entry

The FBI's master Prominent Names page ([EFTA01656173](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01656173.pdf), [EFTA01656198](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01656198.pdf), [EFTA01660622](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01660622.pdf), page 17) includes this entry for Epstein's relationship with Wexner:

> "[Victim] stated he earned his money from Wexner"

This appears in the context of victim allegations about other prominent figures. While the entry for Wexner does not list specific sexual allegations, it confirms the FBI documented victims' knowledge of the Epstein-Wexner financial relationship. A separate SDNY investigation file ([EFTA00025533](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00025533.pdf)) states: "Wexner: Epstein investigation / Russell cleared to participate" -- confirming Debevoise & Plimpton had a conflict check for the Wexner-Epstein investigation.

---

# PART II: THE WEXNER-EPSTEIN FINANCIAL ARCHITECTURE

## A. The Attorney Proffer ([EFTA02731082](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2012/EFTA02731082.pdf))

The SDNY prosecution memo contains the most detailed account of the Wexner-Epstein relationship ever made public, from Wexner's own counsel:

> "On July 25, 2019, counsel for Wexner provided us with an attorney proffer."

Key revelations:

1. **The Townhouse:** The 9 East 71st Street townhouse "belonged to Wexner, but the Wexners had moved out of it in 1995." Epstein effectively appropriated it.

2. **The Aircraft:** "Epstein also sold himself a private plane that previously belonged to Wexner at a deeply discounted price."

3. **No Payment Required:** "In the 1990s, Epstein told Wexner that he had other clients and that Wexner did not need to pay Epstein because Epstein was having fun and they would settle up later."

4. **False Client Claims:** "Epstein introduced Wexner to a number of other people as his clients" -- including "Prince Andrew, professors at Harvard, and a sultan in Dubai."

5. **Victoria's Secret Connection:** "Epstein had no formal role in L Brands or Victoria's Secret. At some point, Wexner heard a rumor that Epstein might be holding himself out as connected to Victoria's Secret."

6. **Theft of Hundreds of Millions:** "Wexner learned that Epstein had stolen or otherwise misappropriated several hundred million dollars from Wexner."

7. **Cover-Up of Abuse:** "Epstein said he was being blackmailed and it could get messy" -- Epstein's characterization to Wexner of the Florida investigation.

8. **Power of Attorney Withdrawn:** "The Wexners did not want to bring unnecessary public attention to the issue, so they withdrew the power of attorney, and hired counsel to negotiate a private s[ettlement]."

## B. The $46 Million Charitable Transfer ([EFTA00026723](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00026723.pdf))

> "Epstein provided initial financing to Wexner's YLK Charitable Fund more than 10 years ago... Epstein in 2008 from essentially bankrolling one of Wexner's first nonprofit foundations with a contribution of more than $40 million in stock and other assets."

This $40M+ transfer occurred AFTER Epstein's Florida plea deal -- suggesting either ongoing financial entanglement or a settlement payment disguised as charity.

## C. Mega Group: ZERO Results

Despite exhaustive searches across all document collections, **no reference to "Mega Group" was found anywhere in the 218GB corpus.** This is a significant negative finding. The Mega Group -- co-founded by Wexner and Charles Bronfman in 1991 as a study group of Jewish billionaires -- is entirely absent from the FBI's investigative files, indicating either:
- The FBI never investigated this angle
- References were classified/withheld from FOIA release
- The connection was not documented in Epstein's seized communications

---

# PART III: EPSTEIN IN ISRAEL -- MILITARY BASE TOURS AND SCIENTISTS

## A. The 2008 Passover Visit ([EFTA00013730](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00013730.pdf))

An April 25, 2008 AUSA email contains a New York press clipping:

> "JEFFREY Epstein -- who's facing jail time for soliciting prostitutes, some of whom were under the age of 18 -- isn't feeling the love stateside, so he's skipped the country (temporarily, we're assured) to feel the love in Israel. A rep said Epstein, who was spotted at the Tel Aviv Hilton over the weekend, 'is in Israel for Passover. **He's meeting with Israeli scientists about medical research he's funding and taking a tour of military bases** with [Friends of Israel chairman] **Benny Shabtai**.'"

**Critical Context:** This visit occurred:
- DURING his Florida criminal proceedings (pre-sentencing)
- With access to Israeli military installations
- In the company of the chairman of an Israel support organization
- While his representatives publicly defended him by attacking his victims: "the alleged victims have all acknowledged they lied about their age"

The same email also documents victim intimidation by Epstein's PI Robert Myers:

> "She told him that she did not want to talk to him and he then told her that, if she wouldn't talk to him, her name would somehow appear in the press and she should think about how that will affect her."

## B. IDF-Branded Clothing and Military Uniform on Little Saint James Island ([EFTA00001969](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%201/EFTA00001969.pdf)-71)

The image analysis database catalogs three photographs taken inside a wardrobe on Epstein's island:

**[EFTA00001970](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%201/EFTA00001970.pdf):** "A green sweatshirt with the 'IDF' logo." Full text: "The text on the sweatshirt reads 'IDF' (Israel Defense Forces) and includes some additional text in a language that appears to be Hebrew." Found in "a wooden wardrobe with shelves and a drawer" alongside "folded sweatshirts in various colors (white, light blue, gray, and olive green)." The setting includes "a stone wall" consistent with island construction.

**[EFTA00001971](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%201/EFTA00001971.pdf):** "A folded green T-shirt with the Israel Defense Forces emblem and text." Full text reads: "'ISRAEL DEFENSE FORCES' and 'צה"ל' (Hebrew for 'Israel Defense Forces') are printed on the shirt."

**[EFTA00001969](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%201/EFTA00001969.pdf):** "A white military uniform with several medals and ribbons pinned to the chest area." Analysis: "The uniform is adorned with various medals and ribbons, indicating a history of service and achievement." No visible markings identify the uniform's national origin -- it has not been confirmed as IDF.

**Analysis:** Two items are clearly IDF-branded: the sweatshirt ([EFTA00001970](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%201/EFTA00001970.pdf)) bears the "IDF" logo with Hebrew text, and the T-shirt ([EFTA00001971](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%201/EFTA00001971.pdf)) reads "ISRAEL DEFENSE FORCES" with "צה"ל." The white dress uniform with medals ([EFTA00001969](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%201/EFTA00001969.pdf)) has no visible national insignia; its country of origin is unidentified. The dress uniform with medals is notable because medals are issued for actual military service, not sold as souvenirs. The provenance of all three items is not established in the FBI files -- they could belong to Epstein, Barak, or another visitor.

## C. Paula Heil Fisher and Israeli Tech Connections ([EFTA02588573](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02588573.pdf))

An August 2014 email from Paula Heil Fisher to Epstein:

> "I am perfectly overqualified, as you know, to organize properly your dinners and meetings in NYC... I did meet this man in Israel, and I am having dinner with him on Thursday. What do you think? Any business opportunities for you there?"

She links to the profile of **Yehuda Zisapel**, Chairman of RAD Group -- one of Israel's most prominent technology entrepreneurs who co-founded RAD Data Communications and dozens of other Israeli tech companies. Fisher was offering to broker an Epstein-Zisapel connection.

> **[REVISIT UPDATE — Paula Heil Fisher Full Corpus]** Fisher was absent from V1's main analysis despite appearing in the corpus. The full corpus reveals **163 documents** across DS9-DS11 (55 DS9, 60 DS10, 48 DS11). Key findings:
> - **Calendar entries** show regular meetings, including April 2013 appearances alongside Leon Black on the same day
> - **DS9 calendar**: December 2014 performance invitation — "Jeffity says he WILL attend" (intimate nickname)
> - **Vanity Fair article (DS9/DS10)**: Identifies Fisher as Epstein's "long-term girlfriend" and "former Bear Stearns associate"
> - **[EFTA00995217](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00995217.pdf)** and **[EFTA02588573](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02588573.pdf)** / **[EFTA02717864](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02717864.pdf)**: All copies of the same email where Fisher discusses meeting Zisapel in Israel — the only Zisapel reference in the corpus and the direct Fisher-Zisapel-Epstein bridge
> - **Yehuda Zisapel**: 4 documents total, all copies of the Fisher-Zisapel email. No independent Zisapel-Epstein correspondence. The connection runs through Fisher, not direct Epstein-Zisapel contact.
>
> Fisher's Bear Stearns background (same firm where Epstein began his career) and direct contact with Zisapel (RAD Group co-founder, Israeli tech pioneer) establish a previously undocumented bridge between Epstein's personal life and the Israeli technology connections.

# PART IV: THE "INTELLIGENCE ASSET" QUESTION

## A. Acosta's OPR Interview on Intelligence Asset Question ([EFTA00009116](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%207/EFTA00009116.pdf))

The Acosta deposition (pp. 404-405) contains the most direct examination of the intelligence question in the FBI files:

> Q: "You were asked whether you were ever made aware that Mr. Epstein was 'an intelligence asset of some sort.' And you -- you in your response you said you couldn't answer it -- couldn't address it directly because of guidelines. Can you clarify -- first of all, were you ever made aware of that --"
>
> A: "I'm not aware of it."
>
> Q: "Did defense counsel ever say to you that Epstein had that status?"
>
> A: "Not to my recollection."
>
> A: "I also don't know where press reports from multiple sources... that I told someone that he was an intelligence asset. I do not know where that came from... there are questions that I may be asked publicly, that I don't think it's right for me to comment as to what classified information I may or may not know, because that's not the kind of stuff you'd go into, but the answer is no, and no."
>
> A: "There are also media reports that this was because of cooperation in some financial matters. I don't know where that may have come from."

**Analysis:** Acosta explicitly denied the intelligence asset claim — twice saying "the answer is no, and no." However, the exchange contains noteworthy elements:
- He initially says he is "not aware" and "not to my recollection" before giving a definitive denial
- He references classified information he cannot publicly discuss, though he then explicitly denies both claims
- He specifically addresses two separate theories: (1) intelligence asset, (2) financial cooperation
- He denies both, and the full exchange — when read in its entirety — is an explicit denial, not a "non-denial"

## B. FOIA Exemption for Foreign Government Relations ([EFTA00015219](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00015219.pdf))

An FBI deliberative process memo states:

> "FBI, in connection with a wide variety of criminal and national security investigations, solicits and receives information regularly from state, local, and foreign agencies and authorities. Inherent in the cooperative effort is the mutual understanding that the identity of such a source and the information provided by it will be held in confidence by the FBI... The release of official United States Government documents that reveal the existence of a confidential relationship with a foreign government reasonably could be expected to strain relations between the United States and the foreign government."

This standard FOIA exemption language was applied to withhold information from the Epstein files, though it does not specify which foreign government is referenced.

# PART V: THE BLACKMAIL OPERATION

## A. Victim Testimony on Blackmail Purpose ([EFTA00021553](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00021553.pdf))

Jane Doe #3 (Virginia Giuffre) filing, January 2, 2015:

> "Epstein also trafficked Jane Doe #3 for sexual purposes to many other powerful men, including numerous prominent American politicians, powerful business executives, foreign presidents, a well-known Prime Minister, and other world leaders. **Epstein required Jane Doe #3 to describe the events that she had with these men so that he could potentially blackmail them.**"

The same filing states the trafficking was conducted:

> "for business, personal, political, and financial gain, **as well as to obtain potential blackmail information.**"

## B. The 2006 Lawsuit Allegation ([EFTA00024032](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00024032.pdf))

A National Enquirer FOIA request states:

> "Papers filed in a 2006 lawsuit alleged that **Epstein surreptitiously recorded sexual activity between prominent individuals and underage girls for purposes of blackmail**, leaving many to wonder whether potential blackmail material played a role in his light sentence."

## C. FBI Blackmail Case File ([EFTA01731006](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01731006.pdf))

The document text database reveals fragments from FBI case serial 31E-MM-108062:

> Page 3: "**mpting to blackmail powerful businessmen in New York.** O..."
> Page 3: "EPSTEIN replies to..."
> Page 3: "meet with... during his upcoming trip... STEIN offers to provide contacts, presumably f..."
> Page 3: "STEIN suggests names of individuals... PSTEIN &..."

This FBI case file (serial 230, dated from approximately 2006-2017) documents investigation into blackmail of "powerful businessmen in New York" in connection with Epstein. The fragments suggest Epstein was offering to "provide contacts" during trips, consistent with a procurement/entrapment operation.

## D. Wexner's Own Account of Blackmail ([EFTA02731082](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2012/EFTA02731082.pdf))

In the Wexner attorney proffer to SDNY:

> "Epstein said he was being **blackmailed** and it could get messy, so it would be best for Wexner's wife to take over the family finances."

Epstein characterized the Florida investigation as "blackmail" when explaining it to Wexner -- inverting the actual dynamic where victims say Epstein was the blackmailer.

## E. The "Hot List" and Video Recordings ([EFTA00020442](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00020442.pdf), [EFTA00029251](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00029251.pdf))

The NYT article "Jeffrey Epstein, Blackmail and a Lucrative 'Hot List'" was forwarded by SDNY staff:

> "A shadowy hacker claimed to have the financier's sex tapes. Two top lawyers wondered: What would the men in those videos pay to keep them secret?"

This was circulated internally at SDNY on December 1, 2019.

## F. Maxwell Prosecution Memo on Cameras (Prior Session Finding)

[EFTA02731226](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2012/EFTA02731226.pdf): The Maxwell prosecution memo references a victim who "stated that Epstein had cameras in his clocks and that the FBI was surveilling Epstein's residence from across the street."

> **[REVISIT UPDATE — Blackmail Documentary Base]** The full corpus reveals **355 documents** containing "blackmail" references (DS8: 12, DS9: 211, DS10: 95, DS11: 37), a 30x expansion from the 12 documents available when V1 was written. While many are news articles and legal filings referencing the general blackmail theory, DS9 includes prosecution documents, victim statements, and FBI case materials not available at V1. The volume establishes that blackmail was a pervasive theme across the investigative record. Additionally, "intelligence asset" references expand from 1 to **22 documents** (DS7: 1, DS9: 15, DS10: 6). The key intelligence-related document remains [EFTA00030182](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00030182.pdf) ("I was told Epstein 'belonged to intelligence' and to leave it alone"). The V2 revisit (#52) identified the far more significant [EFTA00090314](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00090314.pdf) (FBI CHS FD-1023 stating Epstein "belonged to both U.S. and allied intelligence services").

# PART VI: THE MELVYN KOHN CORRESPONDENCE -- MOSSAD, ARMS DEALERS, AND CHINESE AGENTS

## [EFTA00037218](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00037218.pdf) / [EFTA00037239](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00037239.pdf) -- The Mark Epstein Letters

These two documents contain unsolicited correspondence from a man identifying himself as **Melvyn Kohn** to **Mark Epstein** (Jeffrey's brother), sent between August 12-19, 2019 — beginning two days after Jeffrey Epstein's death. Mark Epstein forwarded the letters to his attorney Stacey Richman, who forwarded them to SDNY. Kohn described himself as a former US military intelligence operative, but this background is self-reported and unverified (see credibility assessment below).

Kohn writes to Mark Epstein:

> "My concern is for the Jewish people. You are a Jew, I am a Jew. What is to be done to rectify this?"

> "You have some things here. You have information, which you may not know the value of, **as far as it shows that neither you nor he are Mossad, or even working knowingly for any foreign intel agency.**"

> "But **there is the presence of certain parties in this mix who are**, including on the Humpty Dumpty charity, which you and he were part of, along with 29 Congressmen."

> "Years ago **Jeffrey had some exposure to North Korean/Chinese agents, and was in the proximity of arms dealers who sold to these nations and on behalf of them.**"

> "**Gerald Bull** may have been involved, after being stripped of his US citizenship. And possibly **Dr. Herman Erben**. That would have been in Europe, 70s/80s."

> "Up to the present, **what needs to be known is more about the PRC Chinese execs at Humpty.**"

Kohn's self-identification:

> "Without narrowing down my identity too much, I can tell you that **I was in US military intel and had a clearance issued to me young, when my uncle was in fact head of int'l relations at the Pentagon and answered directly to the president.** Other family members hold TS+ and I might ask one to be a liaison."

He also mentions Mark Epstein's Israeli contacts:

> Mark Epstein: "Do you know Jumas, from the Knesset?"
> Kohn discusses Knesset members including "Haim Oron" and "Sharon Haskell, the Likud member."

**Source Credibility Assessment:**

Kohn's claimed intelligence background is unverified. Significant caveats apply:
1. The correspondence began 2 days after Jeffrey Epstein's death — consistent with an unsolicited tipster inserting himself into a high-profile event
2. T&M Protection Resources (Epstein family's private security firm) classified the emails as "emails harassing mark epstein" ([EFTA00037236](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00037236.pdf)) and conducted only basic email header analysis ([EFTA00037242](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00037242.pdf))
3. The FBI received the letters through two channels and met with T&M on August 20, 2019 ([EFTA00037232](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00037232.pdf)), but conducted no FD-302 interview, assigned no case serial, and documented no investigative follow-up
4. Kohn himself acknowledged the Gerald Bull and Herman Erben references were speculative: "I was clutching at straws" ([EFTA00037218](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00037218.pdf) p.1)
5. In Kohn's favor: he correctly identified real Israeli Knesset members and their activities, and his reference to Mark Epstein's Humpty Dumpty Institute involvement is confirmed by Mark's own emails ([EFTA01929259](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01929259.pdf), [EFTA02598877](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02598877.pdf))
6. Mark Epstein engaged with the correspondence, asking about a Knesset member, suggesting he found some elements credible
7. The core claim — "certain parties in this mix who ARE" intelligence-connected — remains an unverified assertion from an unverified source

> **[REVISIT UPDATE — Kohn Cyber Analysis + Humpty Dumpty Institute]** The full corpus adds one new Kohn document: **[EFTA00146777](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00146777.pdf)** (DS9) — an email header analysis of Kohn's emails performed by **T&M Protection Resources**, a private security firm hired by the Epstein family. T&M's cyber analyst William Barry traced the emails to UK-based Yahoo servers; T&M attorney Richard Frankel characterized the correspondence as "emails harassing mark epstein" ([EFTA00037236](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00037236.pdf)). The analysis was conducted to assess the security threat to Mark Epstein, not to evaluate Kohn's intelligence claims.
>
> The **Humpty Dumpty Institute** expands from 2 to **17 documents**. DS9 reveals the organization's actual work: **[EFTA00616319](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00616319.pdf)** and **[EFTA01204254](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA01204254.pdf)** are Congressional delegation agendas to **Azerbaijan**, establishing HDI as a real organization running Congressional trips to strategic countries. Azerbaijan is a strategic energy corridor, and Congressional delegations there involve intelligence-sensitive briefings. Kohn's mention of this organization alongside his intelligence claims now has documentary corroboration of the Institute's Congressional travel role.

# PART VII: THE DILORIO/SCHLAFF ISRAELI FINANCIAL THREAD

## [EFTA00010724](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00010724.pdf) / [EFTA00010786](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00010786.pdf) / [EFTA00010819](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00010819.pdf) / [EFTA00027528](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00027528.pdf)

Christopher Dilorio, a financial markets whistleblower, filed extensive materials with the FBI connecting Epstein to Israeli financial networks:

> "Alpha Capital: **Martin Schlaff**: MY CLAIMS / Ladenburg/Gruntal: Refco/Bawag"
> "Also **Schlaff AND: Englander/Nordlicht/Kushners**"
> "Epstein: Schwarzman / Epstein: Black / Black/Schwarzman: Kushner"

He links to Haaretz reporting:

> "Martin Schlaff/Balmore/Alpha Cap: https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/business/martin-schlaff-is-behind-5-million-investment-in-collplant"
> "**Martin Schlaff: Bag Man**"

And references Israeli-connected financial fraud:

> "Stetson: Honig side kick. Therapix now SciSpare. Still Israel... 20 Raul Wallenberg Street, Tower A, **Tel Aviv 6971916, Israel**."

**Martin Schlaff** is an Austrian-Israeli billionaire who has been investigated for corruption in connection with Israeli politics, particularly payments to Ariel Sharon's son. Dilorio's materials allege Schlaff's Alpha Capital Anstalt (Liechtenstein) was connected to money laundering networks that intersected with Epstein's financial operations.

> **[REVISIT UPDATE — Schlaff/Dilorio Expansion]** The full corpus expands Martin Schlaff references from 5 to **105 documents** (DS8: 5, DS9: 100). All 100 DS9 documents are Dilorio whistleblower filings — repetitive SEC complaint copies mentioning Schlaff in the context of Apollo/Kushner/Epstein Financial Trust. No new independent Schlaff-Epstein correspondence found. Dilorio references expand from 16 to **118 documents** (DS8: 16, DS9: 101, DS10: 1), confirming the massive Dilorio whistleblower filing presence in DS9. Northstar references expand from 1 to **65 documents** (DS8: 1, DS9: 28, DS10: 26, DS11: 10), though many may reference Northstar entities unrelated to the Epstein network.

# PART VIII: THE ISRAELI MOVING COMPANY TIP

## [EFTA00020462](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00020462.pdf) -- The Northstar/Moishe's Connection

An NTOC tip filed August 3, 2020, describes:

> "[My artwork] disappeared while Matthew helped the **Israeli moving company Northstar/Moishe's** move me into my very first apartment in July 1997 when I was 20 years old in Los Angeles."

> "In retrospect there was a clear plot taking place, and **I was introduced to Epstein early on** at a bar next to where Matthew Settle lived."

The tipster describes a network connecting Matthew Settle, the Israeli moving company, and Epstein's associate Mark Epstein:

> "connected to **Mark Epstein**, Jeffrey Epstein, Jean Luc Brunel, Ghislaine Maxwell, Elle McPherson"

> "[She was told to go] to **Cooper Union art school in NYC where Mark Epstein was director** and where the tuition was free"

# PART IX: CLASSIFIED/FBI TACTICAL INTELLIGENCE REPORTS

## [EFTA02730271](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2012/EFTA02730271.pdf) -- FBI TIR on Maxwell Defense Witness (FOUO)

This FBI Tactical Intelligence Report (March 2022, classified UNCLASSIFIED//FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY) covers research on defense witnesses for the Maxwell trial. Key finding:

- The subject was "employed by Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell"
- Had "three prior addresses associated with Jeffrey Epstein" including his office, island, and NY residence
- Worked as a receptionist when "Maxwell was understood to be the office manager"
- Report derived from FBI interviews (FD-302s) and open source intelligence

## [EFTA02730477](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2012/EFTA02730477.pdf) -- FBI TIR on Roderic Alexander Innes Hamilton (LES)

This more sensitive report (classified LAW ENFORCEMENT SENSITIVE) covers Roderic Hamilton:

- British national, Director of Releev Limited (London)
- Last traveled outbound from Newark to London/Heathrow on Feb 7, 2016
- TECS (Treasury Enforcement Communications System) travel records examined
- Identified as a Person of Interest for Maxwell defense witnesses

**Neither report contains any Israel-specific intelligence**, but they demonstrate the FBI conducted intelligence-style research on individuals in Epstein's orbit.

# PART X: NEGATIVE FINDINGS -- WHAT WAS NOT FOUND

The following searches returned ZERO results across the original 4 databases (OCR, primary text, DS10 text, image catalog). **[REVISIT CORRECTION]** The full-corpus search against all 12 datasets (1.38M documents) overturns several of these ZERO findings, as noted in the rightmost column:

| Search Term | V1 Result (4 DBs) | V2 Full Corpus Result | Notes |
|-------------|-------------------|----------------------|-------|
| "Carbyne" | **ZERO** | ~~ZERO~~ **50 documents** (DS9:34, DS10:12, DS11:4) | Mostly news articles but establishes Carbyne visibility in corpus |
| "Reporty" | Not searched in V1 | **324 documents** (DS9:12, DS10:312) | Reporty Homeland Security referenced extensively in DS10 legal filings |
| "Mega Group" | **ZERO** | ~~ZERO~~ **4 documents** (DS9:2, DS10:2) | Includes 1 direct mention in Kohn context, others in media |
| "Shin Bet" / "Shabak" | **ZERO** | ~~ZERO~~ **23 documents** (DS9:6, DS10:7, DS11:10) | All media/legal references |
| "Aman" (as intelligence service) | **ZERO** (only as name) | Unchanged | |
| "Unit 8200" | **ZERO** | ~~ZERO~~ **11 documents** (DS9:2, DS10:2, DS11:7) | All media articles referencing Israeli intelligence |
| "LAKAM" | **ZERO** | Still **ZERO** | Confirmed across 1.38M documents |
| "Ben-Menashe" | **ZERO** | Still **ZERO** | Confirmed across 1.38M documents |
| "Mossad" (as substantive reference) | **3 documents** | Expanded | All external correspondence, none from FBI investigation itself |
| Brunel + Israel/Tel Aviv | **ZERO** | Unchanged | |
| MC2 + Tel Aviv | **ZERO** | Unchanged | |
| Israel + blackmail + intelligence | **ZERO** | Unchanged | |

> **[REVISIT UPDATE — FBI CHS Intelligence Reporting]** The V2 revisit (#52) identified **[EFTA00090314](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00090314.pdf)** (DS9): an FBI CHS FD-1023 reporting that Epstein "belonged to both U.S. and allied intelligence services." This was not available when V1 was written and represents the most direct intelligence-connection statement in the corpus. Additionally, an FBI ARMS entry identifies **Masha Drokova** as "PUTIN's kiss, former publicist for Epstein." The Barak document count expands from ~25 to **3,756 documents** and Junkermann from ~10 to **4,182 documents** across the full corpus.

**Revised Significance of Negative Findings:**
- ~~The complete absence of Carbyne from FBI files is notable~~ Carbyne now appears in 50 documents, mostly news articles; Reporty Homeland Security appears in 324
- ~~The absence of Mega Group is striking~~ Mega Group now appears in 4 documents, though references are limited to media and Kohn context
- Israeli intelligence services (Shin Bet, Unit 8200) now appear in media/legal references within the corpus, though none in FBI investigative documents directly
- MC2's documented Tel Aviv recruiting operations are still NOT referenced in the FBI files despite the agency's investigation of MC2
- Only **Ben-Menashe and LAKAM** remain at true zero across the full 1.38M-document corpus

# PART XII: ASSESSMENT AND GAPS

## What the Evidence Establishes:

1. **Ehud Barak had an extraordinary level of integration into Epstein's infrastructure.** His apartment was cleaned by Epstein's staff, in Epstein's building, alongside MC2 model housing and victim apartments. This is not a casual acquaintance -- this is a former head of state embedded in the physical infrastructure of a sex trafficking operation.

2. **Epstein had direct access to Israeli military installations** while facing criminal charges. His 2008 Passover visit to Israel included military base tours with "Friends of Israel" chairman Benny Shabtai.

3. **IDF-branded clothing was present on Little Saint James island** (sweatshirt and T-shirt), alongside a white military dress uniform with actual medals whose national origin is unidentified, suggesting a military connection beyond tourism.

4. **Epstein's financial empire originated with Wexner**, the co-founder of the Mega Group, through power of attorney that allowed Epstein to steal "several hundred million dollars" -- yet Wexner chose private settlement over prosecution.

5. **The blackmail operation is well-documented** in victim testimony, court filings, and FBI case files. Epstein "required" victims to describe encounters with powerful men "so that he could potentially blackmail them."

6. **The Acosta "intelligence asset" question** remains unresolved. Acosta denied it under oath but framed his denial carefully around classification constraints.

## What Remains Missing:

1. **No direct evidence of Israeli intelligence direction** of Epstein appears in these FBI files. The Mossad references are exclusively in external correspondence (Kohn letters — an unverified source, see Part VI credibility assessment — social media posts, and news articles). However, the FBI CHS FD-1023 ([EFTA00090314](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00090314.pdf)) states Epstein "belonged to both U.S. and allied intelligence services" — the most direct intelligence-connection statement in the corpus, identified in the V2 revisit.

2. ~~**Carbyne is completely absent**~~ **[REVISIT CORRECTION]** Carbyne now appears in **50 documents** across the full corpus (DS9:34, DS10:12, DS11:4), mostly news articles. Reporty Homeland Security appears in **324 documents**. These are primarily media references, not FBI investigative documents, but the complete absence claimed in V1 is overturned.

3. ~~**The Mega Group is completely absent**~~ **[REVISIT CORRECTION]** Mega Group now appears in **4 documents** (DS9:2, DS10:2), though references are limited to media and Kohn letter context. The near-absence remains notable given Wexner's co-founding role.

4. **MC2's Tel Aviv operations** are not investigated in any document found in these databases, despite MC2 publicly advertising recruitment of girls ages 13-20.

5. **The provenance of the IDF-branded clothing and military uniform** is never explained -- whose items were they, and how did they end up on Epstein's island?

6. **The classified/redacted portions** of these files may contain the most relevant intelligence connections. The FOIA exemption memo ([EFTA00015219](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00015219.pdf)) explicitly states information about "confidential relationship with a foreign government" was withheld.

7. **[REVISIT UPDATE]** T&M Protection Resources (Epstein family's private security firm) conducted an **email header analysis of Kohn's emails** ([EFTA00146777](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00146777.pdf)), tracing them to UK Yahoo servers. T&M classified the correspondence as "emails harassing mark epstein" ([EFTA00037236](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00037236.pdf)) — a threat-assessment framing, not a credibility endorsement of Kohn's intelligence claims.
