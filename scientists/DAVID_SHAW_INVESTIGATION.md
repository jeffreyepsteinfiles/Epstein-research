## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

David E. Shaw -- billionaire founder of D.E. Shaw & Co. (one of the world's largest hedge funds, $60B+ AUM) and founder of D.E. Shaw Research (computational biology) -- appears in the Epstein DOJ files primarily through **one extraordinarily significant document**: [EFTA02114558](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA02114558.pdf), a neuroscience dinner planning email where Neil Gershenfeld (MIT) proposes Shaw as a guest at Epstein's NYC residence, with Epstein holding veto power over the guest list.

**Key Finding:** Shaw was proposed as an invitee to an elite neuroscience dinner at Epstein's townhouse on March 14, 2014 -- more than 5 years after Epstein's 2008 sex trafficking conviction. The dinner was organized by MIT and Princeton scientists who cc'd "Jeff" (Epstein) for approval of the guest list, demonstrating Epstein's role as science patron and gatekeeper.

**Critical Limitation:** The databases do NOT contain evidence that Shaw actually attended the dinner. The document shows he was proposed as a potential invitee. No response from Shaw or confirmation of attendance has been found.

### 1.4 Redaction Analysis

The document contained both proper redactions and bad_overlay redactions:
- **bad_overlay on Page 0:** Exposed Gershenfeld's line: "Don't have a strong opinion, cc[ing Jeff to see if he does]"
- **bad_overlay on Page 1:** Exposed Apple PLIST metadata (email account: jeevacation@gmail.com)
- **3 proper redactions** on Page 0 (email addresses successfully redacted)
- **2 proper redactions** on Page 1

### 1.5 Critical Analysis

This document is significant for several reasons:

1. **Epstein as Science Gatekeeper:** Gershenfeld explicitly cc's "Jeff" to get his opinion on dinner invitees, confirming Epstein had veto power over who attended elite science gatherings at his home.

2. **Post-Conviction Access:** This dinner was planned for March 14, 2014 -- more than 5 years after Epstein's 2008 sex trafficking conviction and guilty plea. World-class scientists were still treating Epstein as a legitimate science patron.

3. **Casual Name-Dropping of Shaw:** Gershenfeld mentions "David E. Shaw?" as a potential invitee with the same casualness as mentioning other scientists, suggesting Shaw was known to the group and considered a natural fit for these gatherings.

4. **Lesley Groff's Role:** Boyden sends his flight itinerary to Lesley Groff (Epstein's executive assistant), confirming the dinner was hosted at Epstein's residence and Epstein's staff handled logistics.

5. **Subject Line "deception":** The email subject is "deception" and the topic is "a contrarian disruptive perspective on creating and understanding brains, consciousness" -- suggesting the dinner's intellectual theme related to deception/perception in neuroscience. The "Deception" topic was a multi-session initiative: a Sept 6, 2013 Skype with Joi Ito, Kevin Slavin, and Reid Hoffman also addressed this theme ([EFTA00284801](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00284801.pdf)).

6. **Dinner Disrupted (DS9 finding):** [EFTA00372888](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00372888.pdf) reveals the March 14, 2014 dinner was partially canceled. Ed Boyden sent a last-minute cancellation: "My apologies -- for the Obama BRAIN initiative, I need to work at MIT today to coordinate the activities of a bunch of groups for a Monday deadline." Groff replied: "Jeffrey prefers to either reschedule for April in NY or he could come to Boston possibly sometime April 23-25... Jeffrey was flying in for the dinner so he prefers to reschedule." Seung replied: "I agree... getting all of us in the same room at the same time is obviously difficult, so **four out of five isn't bad**." Judith Donath indicated she was in NYC that evening, suggesting a smaller gathering may have proceeded without Epstein and Boyden. Epstein's calendar ([EFTA00284873](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00284873.pdf)) lists: "12:00pm Lunch w/Neil Gershenfeld, Judith, Ed, Sebastatian for Neuro/Deception" -- confirming the event was planned as a lunch, not dinner. This further weakens any inference about Shaw's proposed attendance at what was, in its original form, a gathering that did not proceed as planned.

## SECTION 3: SHAW IN THE BROADER EPSTEIN SCIENCE NETWORK

### 3.1 The Epstein Science Dinner Pattern

The [EFTA02114558](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA02114558.pdf) dinner was not an isolated event. The corpus reveals a systematic pattern of Epstein-hosted science dinners:

Note: Ed Boyden's travel was reimbursed by Epstein's foundation (AmEx Centurion bookings [EFTA00290723](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00290723.pdf); Gershenfeld travel reimbursement [EFTA00373002](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00373002.pdf)).

### 3.2 The Gershenfeld Connection

Neil Gershenfeld appears in 4+ documents as a key intermediary:

| EFTA | Content | Date |
|------|---------|------|
| [EFTA01939169](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01939169.pdf) | **To:** Neil Gershenfeld, **Cc:** Sebastian Seung, Jeffrey Epstein | Undated |
| [EFTA02114558](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA02114558.pdf) | Neuroscience dinner planning (Shaw proposed) | Feb 2014 |
| [EFTA02115011](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA02115011.pdf) | Judith Donath, Neil Gershenfeld, Sebastian, on behalf of Ed Boyden | Undated |
| [EFTA02115646](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA02115646.pdf) | Gershenfeld's travel arrangements (reception mentioned) | Undated |
| [EFTA02133356](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA02133356.pdf) | Neil Gershenfeld correspondence | Undated |

**Key finding from [EFTA01939169](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01939169.pdf):** This document explicitly shows an email **To: Neil Gershenfeld**, **Cc: Sebastian Seung** and **Jeffrey Epstein** -- directly confirming Epstein was part of the science communication loop and not merely a passive host.

### 3.3 The Brockman/Edge Foundation Pipeline

The Epstein science network operated through multiple parallel channels:

1. **John Brockman / Edge Foundation** -- The primary pipeline documented in [EFTA00018466](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00018466.pdf) (NYT/SDNY clips):
   > "Mr. Epstein appears to have gained entree into the scientific community through John Brockman, a literary agent... For two decades, Mr. Brockman presided over a [gathering of scientists and] potential benefactors. (The so-called 'billionaires' dinners' [were held at] Epstein's East 71st Street townhouse, which included some of the same guests.)"
   > "In 2004, Mr. Brockman hosted a dinner at the Indian Summer restaurant in Monterey, Calif., where Mr. Epstein was introduced to scientists, including Seth Lloyd, the M.I.T. physicist."

2. **MIT Media Lab / Joi Ito** -- Documented in 10+ EFTA documents:
   - [EFTA02377042](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02377042.pdf): Joi Ito dinner at Epstein's with Woody Allen and Ed Boyden
   - [EFTA02575363](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02575363.pdf): Epstein inviting Joi Ito AND Reid Hoffman to Columbus Day weekend
   - [EFTA02589077](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02589077.pdf): Joi Ito arranging US Treasury call to include Epstein

3. **Direct Science Patron Network** -- The Gershenfeld/Seung/Boyden circle ([EFTA02114558](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA02114558.pdf) and related)

4. **Martin Nowak / Harvard** -- Documented in [EFTA02108058](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA02108058.pdf), [EFTA02109316](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA02109316.pdf), [EFTA02110197](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA02110197.pdf)

### 3.4 Epstein's Scientist Master Lists (DS9 Finding)

[EFTA00307028](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00307028.pdf)-[EFTA00307035](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00307035.pdf) contain two master scientist lists from Epstein's schedule (late May-early June 2013, World Science Festival period):

**"JE's LIST OF SCIENTIST's":** Vinton Cerf, Dennis S. Charney, James Fallon, Elaine Fuchs, Neil Gershenfeld, John Holdren ("No"), Petr Janata, Seth Lloyd ("Yes"), Maja Mataric, Lyman Page, David Spergel, Suzanne Staggs, Edward O. Wilson ("No"), Adam Wilson

**"BRIAN GREENE'S PREFERRED LIST OF SCIENTISTS":** Dr. Boaz Almog, Ryan Chin, Dennis Hong, Julia R. Greer, Eitan Grinspun, John Holdren (White House Science Director), Ellen Jorgensen, Eric Lander (Broad Institute Director), John C. Mather, Siddhartha Mukherjee, William Phillips (Nobel), Oliver Sacks, Harold Varmus (NCI Director), Edward O. Wilson

**David E. Shaw does NOT appear on either list.** This further confirms Shaw was not in Epstein's inner science circle despite being proposed for the March 2014 dinner by Gershenfeld.

**David E. Shaw exists at the intersection of ALL these networks:**
- His computational biology work connects to the Edge Foundation science circle
- His hedge fund status makes him a "billionaire dinner" candidate in Brockman's framework
- His MIT connections (Columbia CS faculty, science advisory boards) overlap with the Media Lab network
- His proposed attendance at the Gershenfeld dinner directly places him in the Epstein-hosted science gathering pattern
- However, Shaw is absent from Epstein's own scientist master lists, absent from the 2015 Palo Alto dinner with Zuckerberg/Musk/Thiel, and absent from all DS9 calendars

## SECTION 4: D.E. SHAW & CO. IN THE DOJ FILES

### 4.1 [EFTA00010819](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00010819.pdf) -- D E Shaw and Blackstone Connection

The only document in the corpus that mentions "D E Shaw" by company name is [EFTA00010819](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00010819.pdf), a lengthy whistleblower email from Christopher Dilorio. The relevant excerpt:

> **From:** Chris Dilorio <chris_diorio@msn.com>
> **Sent:** Tuesday, September 1, 2020 7:40 AM
>
> "See below: Jason New: KODK BoD: BX. In charge of the KODK 'internal investigation'. Now we read where **D E Shaw has taken a 5% stake in KODK**. **guess who DE Shaw largest investor is: Blackstone.** Corruption cover up."

**Context:** This email is part of a larger series from SEC whistleblower Christopher Dilorio alleging corrupt connections between Blackstone, D.E. Shaw, and the Kodak (KODK) DFC loan scandal of August 2020. While this document is about financial market corruption rather than Epstein directly, it is in the Epstein DOJ file collection.

**Full image analysis text ([EFTA00010819](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00010819.pdf)):**
> "Now we read where D E Shaw has taken a 5% stake in KODK. guess who DE Shaw largest investor is: Blackstone. Corruption cover up. For the record Janey https://www.thetrustedinsight.com/investment-news/de-shaw-blackstone-20190325420/"

**Relevance:** This document connects D.E. Shaw & Co. to Blackstone Group -- and Blackstone's co-founder Stephen Schwarzman has been noted in other Epstein investigation contexts. However, this is an INDIRECT connection through a whistleblower's claims about market manipulation, not direct evidence of Shaw-Epstein financial flows.

### 4.2 Karla Shaw -- IDENTIFIED: Kimbal Musk's Assistant

| EFTA | Hidden Text |
|------|-------------|
| [EFTA02006000](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA02006000.pdf) | "Jeffrey Epste[in] / Karla Shaw / B / i Nik li[c] / I" |

**Identification (resolved via DS9):** Karla Shaw is definitively identified as **Kimbal Musk's assistant** at The Kitchen & The Kitchen Community, 1980 8th Street, Boulder, CO 80302 (email: karla@thekitchencommunity.org). She coordinated Kimbal Musk's October 2012 lunch meeting with Epstein and Boris Nikolic at 9 East 71st Street.

DS9 documents ([EFTA00403170](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00403170.pdf)-[EFTA00404179](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00404179.pdf)) contain 15+ emails establishing this chain:
- Groff to Karla Shaw: "Jeffrey said yes to having Kimbal come to his home at 11:30 on Sunday!"
- Groff: "I am now trying to find out if **Boris** will be coming as well."
- Kimbal Musk to Boris Nikolic (Sept 21, 2012, [EFTA00404176](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00404176.pdf)): "Fun time last night! **Let Jeffrey and his friends know they are invited tomorrow**"
- Schedule ([EFTA00403463](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00403463.pdf)): "12:00 Lunch w/Kimbal Musk and MAYBE Boris"

Karla Shaw is NOT related to David E. Shaw. The [EFTA02006000](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA02006000.pdf) fragment showing "Karla Shaw / Jeffrey Epstein / Nikolic" was a contact list from this Kimbal Musk meeting coordination.

**Kimbal Musk → Elon Musk pipeline:** [EFTA00391375](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00391375.pdf) (April 29, 2013, Milken Conference) contains an Epstein email: "you should fly straight to new york instead of los angeles. **jenn broke up with kimbal therefore no elon** and most of the fun things will be this afternoon." This confirms Epstein expected to leverage Kimbal's relationship to access Elon Musk, and the breakup disrupted that pipeline. [EFTA00392307](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00392307.pdf) shows Epstein attended the same Milken Conference where "Elon and Kimbal Musk" were featured speakers.

### 5.2 Dubin Breast Center Co-Chair Connection (DS11 Finding)

[EFTA02702727](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02702727.pdf) is a Dubin Breast Center Second Annual Benefit invitation (Monday, December 10, 2012) that was forwarded to Epstein's email (jeevacation@gmail.com). It lists **Beth and David Shaw** as benefit co-chairs alongside:

| Co-Chair | Epstein Connection |
|----------|-------------------|
| Eva and Glenn Dubin | Documented Epstein associate, "lent out" prosecution testimony, 34+ flights |
| Allison and Howard Lutnick | Named in NTOC tip on Prominent Names |
| Sonia and Paul Tudor Jones II | $13.5M Tudor Futures Fund to Epstein's Southern Financial |
| Alexandra and Steven Cohen | Hedge fund billionaire |
| Gabrielle and Louis Bacon | Hedge fund billionaire |

Also on the Benefit Committee: Tommy Mottola and Lorne Michaels.

This establishes that the Shaws moved in the same philanthropic social circuit as multiple documented Epstein associates. However, being a co-chair of a public charity benefit does not establish direct Shaw-Epstein contact or knowledge of Epstein's criminal activities.

### 5.3 What This Means

The absence of David E. Shaw from 99%+ of the corpus is itself a significant finding. Compare Shaw's presence to other Epstein associates:

| Person | Documents | Relationship Evidence |
|--------|-----------|----------------------|
| Leon Black | 100+ | $158M+ in payments, sexual abuse allegations |
| Jes Staley | 50+ | Emails, flights, victim allegations |
| Tom Pritzker | 20+ | Dinners, island development, 10-year relationship |
| Bill Gates | 10+ | Emails, meetings, Nikolic connection |
| Larry Summers | 10+ | Emails, victim allegation, seeking Epstein |
| Reid Hoffman | 5+ | Columbus Day weekend, crypto intro |
| **David E. Shaw** | **1** | **Proposed dinner invitee (attendance unconfirmed)** |

**Shaw's near-total absence from the files suggests one of several possibilities:**
1. Shaw had minimal/no actual contact with Epstein beyond being proposed for one dinner
2. Shaw's communications with Epstein, if any, were not captured in the seized devices/email accounts
3. Shaw's name was successfully redacted in documents that were properly redacted (the 3 proper redactions on [EFTA02114558](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA02114558.pdf) page 0 could include email addresses)
4. Shaw may have attended dinners or events without leaving email traces (in-person invitations, phone calls)

## SECTION 6: THE NEUROSCIENCE DINNER NETWORK MAP

### 6.1 Overlapping Science Events at Epstein's

The March 14, 2014 dinner was part of a broader pattern. Here is the network map of science events at Epstein's residence documented in the corpus:

```
EPSTEIN NYC RESIDENCE -- SCIENCE EVENT TIMELINE
================================================

2004 -- BROCKMAN "BILLIONAIRES' DINNER" (via EFTA00018466)
  Attendees: Scientists + tech billionaires (Sergey Brin, Larry Page, Jeff Bezos)
  Organizer: John Brockman / Edge Foundation
  Location: Indian Summer restaurant, Monterey + Epstein's 71st St townhouse

2011 -- BROCKMAN-EPSTEIN COMMUNICATION (EFTA01997632)
  From: John Brockman
  Date: January 20, 2011

2013 -- WOODY ALLEN / ITO / BOYDEN / PRITZKER DINNER (EFTA02377042)

  Attendees: Woody Allen, Soon Yi, Joi Ito, Ed Boyden, Tom Pritzker
  Location: Epstein's NYC residence
  Time: 7:30 PM (Allen), 8:00 PM (Ito/Boyden), 9:00 PM (Pritzker)

2013 -- BOYDEN COMMUNICATION (EFTA02131219)
  Date: August 2, 2013
  Ed Boyden email

2014 -- GERSHENFELD/SEUNG/BOYDEN/DONATH NEUROSCIENCE DINNER (EFTA02114558)
  Date: March 14, 2014

  To: Jeffrey Epstein

2015 -- BROCKMAN-EPSTEIN DIRECT (EFTA02501737)
  Date: May 12, 2015
  Discussion: Sam Harris, Jennifer Doudna
  "DINNER: Not ready for a big dinner..."

UNDATED -- GERSHENFELD/SEUNG/EPSTEIN (EFTA01939169)
  To: Neil Gershenfeld
  Cc: Sebastian Seung, Jeffrey Epstein
```

### 6.2 The "Jeff Has Veto Power" Pattern

Across multiple documents, the same pattern emerges:
- Scientists organize intellectual gatherings
- Epstein's name is on the CC line or is the host
- Epstein's assistant (Lesley Groff) coordinates logistics
- Epstein has approval/veto authority over the guest list

In [EFTA02114558](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA02114558.pdf), Gershenfeld writes: "Don't have a strong opinion, **cc'ing Jeff to see if he does**."

This establishes that Epstein was not merely providing a venue -- he was an active decision-maker in who attended these elite science gatherings.

---

## SECTION 7: CROSS-REFERENCE ANALYSIS

### 7.1 Shaw and the Jeff Bezos Connection

Jeff Bezos worked at D.E. Shaw & Co. from 1990 to 1994 as a VP. Bezos left Shaw to found Amazon. The Brockman/Edge Foundation network included both Epstein and tech billionaires -- [EFTA00018466](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00018466.pdf) documents:

> "In 2004, Mr. Brockman hosted a dinner at the Indian Summer restaurant in Monterey, Calif., where Mr. Epstein was introduced to scientists..."

The same article references "billionaires' dinners" at Epstein's townhouse. While there is no direct evidence of Shaw attending these Brockman dinners, the social graph strongly suggests proximity:
- Brockman's dinners included tech/science billionaires
- Shaw is both a tech billionaire AND a computational scientist
- Shaw was proposed for the Gershenfeld/Seung dinner circle

### 7.2 Shaw and Deutsche Bank

No direct connection was found between D.E. Shaw & Co. and Epstein's Deutsche Bank accounts. However:
- The same Deutsche Bank relationship manager team (Jj Litchford, Paul Morris) that managed Epstein's 40+ accounts also managed Leon Black's accounts ([EFTA01359500](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01359500.pdf))
- D.E. Shaw & Co. is a major financial institution that would have banking relationships with Deutsche Bank
- No evidence of money flows between Shaw entities and Epstein entities was found in the transaction databases

### 7.3 Shaw and the MIT Network

Shaw's proposed attendance at an MIT-organized dinner is significant because:
- The MIT Media Lab's Joi Ito resigned over undisclosed Epstein donations ($1M+)
- Ed Boyden (MIT) was a confirmed attendee of multiple Epstein dinners
- Gershenfeld (MIT) was a key organizer
- Seth Lloyd (MIT) was documented receiving Epstein funding and attending events through 2017

D.E. Shaw Research has no documented direct connection to MIT in the Epstein files, but Shaw's background as a Columbia CS professor and his computational biology work place him in the same intellectual circles.

### 7.4 [EFTA02006000](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA02006000.pdf) -- Karla Shaw, Epstein, and Nikolic (RESOLVED)

The document [EFTA02006000](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA02006000.pdf) contains a fragmentary redaction showing:
```
Jeffrey Epste[in]
Karla Shaw
B
i Nik li[c]
I
```

This is an email participant list from the October 2012 Kimbal Musk meeting coordination. Karla Shaw is Kimbal Musk's assistant at The Kitchen Community (Boulder, CO), and "Nikoli[c]" is Boris Nikolic, who was invited to the same lunch. See Section 4.2 for full identification. This document has no connection to David E. Shaw.

---

## SECTION 8: CONTEXTUAL ANALYSIS -- WHY SHAW MATTERS

### 8.1 The Science-Finance Nexus

David E. Shaw represents a unique archetype in the Epstein network: the scientific researcher who is also a financial titan. This profile is precisely what Epstein cultivated as part of his "science patron" identity:

- **Epstein claimed to be a science patron** -- His foundation donated to research, he hosted science dinners, he positioned himself as a connector between scientists and donors
- **Shaw IS a science patron** -- D.E. Shaw Research genuinely advances computational biology, and Shaw personally maintains active scientific research programs
- **The mimicry is the key** -- Epstein modeled himself after figures like Shaw to gain credibility in scientific circles

### 8.2 The Dinner Guest List as Social Capital

The fact that Gershenfeld casually proposed "David E. Shaw?" as a dinner invitee reveals several things:

1. **Shaw was known to the group** -- This was not a random suggestion. Gershenfeld expected Shaw to be recognized as a relevant potential attendee.

2. **Shaw was considered accessible** -- Gershenfeld did not suggest Shaw was difficult to reach or unlikely to attend. He listed Shaw alongside other scientists as if they were all in the same social circle.

3. **Shaw fit the profile** -- The dinner topic was "creating and understanding brains, consciousness" -- precisely Shaw's area of interest through D.E. Shaw Research.

4. **Epstein's approval was sought** -- Even for a billionaire like Shaw, the question of whether he could attend was routed through Epstein for approval.

### 8.3 What We Cannot Determine

Based on the available evidence, we CANNOT determine:

- Whether David E. Shaw actually attended the March 14, 2014 dinner
- Whether Shaw had any other contact with Epstein
- Whether Shaw was aware of Epstein's criminal history at the time
- Whether any financial relationship existed between Shaw/D.E. Shaw entities and Epstein entities
- Whether Shaw attended any of the Brockman "billionaires' dinners" at Epstein's townhouse
- Whether Shaw was on Epstein's flight logs (no flight log references found)
- Whether Shaw appears in Epstein's contact books or calendars (none found in databases)

### 9.2 Martin Nowak -- The Harvard Connection

Martin Nowak (Harvard professor, evolutionary dynamics) appears alongside Kevin Slavin in 3 documents where Epstein is directly addressed:
- [EFTA02108058](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA02108058.pdf): **To: Epstein Jeffrey**, Cc includes Nowak and Slavin
- [EFTA02109316](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA02109316.pdf): Nowak, Slavin, Barnaby Marsh
- [EFTA02110197](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA02110197.pdf): Nowak, Slavin, Marsh

Nowak's Harvard lab received $6.5 million in donations from Epstein's foundation (publicly reported). This places Nowak as a major financial beneficiary of Epstein's science patronage.

### 9.3 Barnaby Marsh -- Epstein's Science Advisor

Barnaby Marsh appears as a consistent intermediary between Epstein and the science network:
- [EFTA02108058](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA02108058.pdf), [EFTA02109316](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA02109316.pdf), [EFTA02110197](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA02110197.pdf) -- all with Epstein, Nowak, Slavin
- Marsh is described in public reporting as Epstein's "science advisor"
- His presence in these emails confirms the organizational structure: Marsh coordinated science contacts for Epstein

---

## SECTION 10: FINANCIAL ANALYSIS -- SHAW ENTITY SEARCH

### 10.1 Deutsche Bank Account Search

No D.E. Shaw entities appear in Epstein's Deutsche Bank account structure (RM CODE 82289). The known Epstein accounts include:
- Haze Trust ($40.5M balance Aug 2018)
- Southern Financial LLC
- Southern Trust Company
- Butterfly Trust
- Gratitude America, Ltd
- Plan D LLC
- Various numbered trusts (2017 Caterpillar Trust, etc.)
- Prytanee LLC
- Honeycomb Partners

None of these are connected to D.E. Shaw & Co. or D.E. Shaw Research.

### 10.2 Wire Transfer Search

No wire transfers between Epstein entities and D.E. Shaw entities were found in the transaction records. For comparison, documented wire recipients include:
- Valar Global Fund (Peter Thiel): $28.8M
- Honeycomb Partners: $64M
- Boothbay Fund: $38.25M
- Leon Black entities: $158M+
- Benjamin de Rothschild: $25M
- Tudor Futures Fund: $13.5M

**D.E. Shaw & Co. does NOT appear in any transaction chains.**

### 10.3 Investment Search

No evidence was found that Epstein invested money through D.E. Shaw & Co., or that D.E. Shaw entities received Epstein funds. This contrasts with documented investments in Valar Fund (Thiel), Coatue (Laffont), and others.

## SECTION 13: CONCLUSIONS

### 13.1 What the Evidence Shows

1. **David E. Shaw was part of the social/intellectual universe that Epstein cultivated.** He was known to MIT and Princeton scientists who organized events at Epstein's residence.

2. **Shaw was proposed -- not confirmed -- as an attendee at one Epstein-hosted dinner.** The proposal came from Neil Gershenfeld, an MIT professor who organized neuroscience gatherings at Epstein's townhouse.

3. **Epstein had veto power over the guest list.** Gershenfeld cc'd "Jeff" (Epstein) for approval of potential invitees including Shaw.

4. **No direct communication, financial relationship, or other contact between Shaw and Epstein was found** in 218GB+ of DOJ files spanning 4 databases and millions of records.

5. **Shaw's near-total absence from the corpus stands in stark contrast** to other Epstein associates who appear in dozens or hundreds of documents.

### 13.2 Assessment

**David E. Shaw's exposure in the Epstein DOJ files is LIMITED to being proposed as a potential dinner guest.** There is no evidence of:
- Direct communication with Epstein
- Financial flows between Shaw/D.E. Shaw entities and Epstein entities
- Attendance at any Epstein event
- Presence on flight logs, calendars, or contact lists
- Any sexual misconduct allegations
- Any role in Epstein's criminal enterprise

The most significant aspect of Shaw's appearance is what it reveals about **Epstein's network architecture**: a convicted sex offender was hosting elite neuroscience dinners where billionaire tech founders were casually proposed as guests, with Epstein maintaining approval authority over attendance.

### 13.3 Open Questions

1. **Did Shaw attend the March 14, 2014 dinner?** No confirmation or denial was found.
2. **Was Shaw at any of the earlier Brockman "billionaires' dinners"?** No evidence in the corpus.
3. **Were there communications on channels not captured?** Phone calls, in-person meetings, or communications through intermediaries would not appear in the email-centric DOJ files.
4. **What is behind the 3 proper redactions on [EFTA02114558](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA02114558.pdf)?** These could contain additional email addresses or names relevant to Shaw's involvement.
5. ~~**Who is "Karla Shaw" in [EFTA02006000](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA02006000.pdf)?**~~ **RESOLVED:** Karla Shaw is Kimbal Musk's assistant at The Kitchen Community (Boulder, CO). She coordinated Musk-Epstein lunch meetings via Boris Nikolic. Not related to David E. Shaw.
