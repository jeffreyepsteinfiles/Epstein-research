## SECTION 1: PREVIOUSLY UNMAPPED INDIVIDUALS

### 1.1 LEON PESHKIN (Harvard - Anti-Aging/Longevity Research)
**Status: NEW FINDING - 122 documents across full corpus (55 DS9 / 38 DS10 / 29 DS11)**
- **[EFTA02571042](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02571042.pdf)** (OCR): Email chain between Epstein and Leon Peshkin, June 21, 2018
- Subject: "your crazy scientist friend in the news" - linking to STAT News anti-aging researcher article
- Epstein's response: "sorry about dad... great article... not sure why anti age is a good thing... a complex system i believe as part of an ecology. would be dangerous to the system"
- Peshkin responds: "I also want to understand what is aging... noone knows."
- Peshkin: "I want to give people more time to play, and to dye healthy, once ready."
- **Context**: Peshkin is a Harvard systems biology researcher focused on aging, regeneration, and longevity. This email proves direct intellectual engagement on anti-aging research with Epstein, just 13 months before Epstein's arrest.
- **UPDATED (DS9/DS11 full corpus):** Relationship began July 2016 via Misha Gromov recommendation ([EFTA00322701](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00322701.pdf): Groff to Gromov: "is Leon Peshkin available?"). Gromov described Peshkin as "departed from AI and converged to embryology, proteomic and fast single cell sequencing. Besides he is the man of Genome in a Bottle" ([EFTA00319216](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00319216.pdf)). Peshkin attended the September 2016 gathering at Nowak's Institute with Krauss, Barak, Ito, and Bach ([EFTA00318013](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00318013.pdf): "a memorable occasion, I got to have an argument about existence of God with Ehud Barak and Lawrence Krauss").
- **Significance**: Adds to the network of Harvard scientists with active post-conviction Epstein contact. Peshkin's work on biological aging directly intersects with Epstein's documented transhumanist interests. Relationship spans July 2016 through June 2018.

### 1.2 JOSCHA BACH (AI/Cognitive Architecture Researcher)
**Status: NEW FINDING - 3,934 documents across full corpus (1,777 DS9 / 952 DS10 / 1,205 DS11)**

  - Epstein to Joi Ito: "Joi, joscha is developing interesting A.I. Is there someone who could show him around the media lab"
  - Ito arranges meeting: "Ryan, can you try to make this happen?"
  - Bach's interests: "integrated cognitive architectures (i.e. things that Josh Tenenbaum does), with a focus on computational models of motivation and affect"
  - Bach: "I would also be very interested in learning more about Deb Roy's work"
  - Bach specifically requested meeting Henry Liebermann's group at MIT
  - Ryan McCarthy (MIT Media Lab Development Assistant) coordinated

- **Significance**:
  1. Barnaby Marsh is a Program Officer at the **John Templeton Foundation** (one of the world's largest private science funders, $3.4B endowment).
  2. Marsh was a regular in Epstein's inner science circle, directly alongside Martin Nowak and Kevin Slavin.
  3. Epstein used Marsh to try to arrange a meeting with **James Simons** (Renaissance Technologies, $28B net worth), one of the most important mathematicians/hedge fund managers in the world.
  4. The Templeton Foundation connection is particularly significant because Templeton funds research into "big questions" including consciousness, free will, and human flourishing -- directly overlapping with Epstein's stated transhumanist interests.
  5. Epstein was in Paris communicating with Marsh in May 2016 and planning NYC meetings in January 2017 -- all post-conviction.
  6. **UPDATED (DS9/DS11 full corpus):** Marsh appears in "7:00am SKYPE w/Barnaby Marsh" entries across dozens of Epstein calendar entries (2014-2016+). Marsh compiled a 60+-name "92nd St Y potential list" for Epstein ([EFTA02343458](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02343458.pdf), December 2014) including Musk, Thiel, Brin, Kurzweil, Dalai Lama, Church, Venter, Diamandis, and multiple Nobel laureates. Epstein responded: "we will have to go through each one of these names and people videos etc." Marsh was actively working as Epstein's science talent scout. He also flew with Epstein to Bedford for Harvard trips.

This documented relationship includes: repeated vacation socializing in BVI/St. Barths (Christmas 2012 and 2013); Epstein offering helicopter transport to his island; Musk asking about "the wildest party on your island"; Epstein offering to bring "assistants (four)" who "might enjoy the facility"; Epstein serving as intermediary between Musk and Sultan bin Sulayem (DP World chairman); and the relationship spanning at least September 2012 through August 2015, all post-conviction.

### 3.4 Assessment
The VERIFIED evidence now includes: (1) Musk's email in Epstein's contact records; (2) SpaceX hosting an Epstein-organized event; (3) Deutsche Bank offering Epstein SpaceX stock access; and (4) **15+ direct email exchanges (2012-2015) revealing an extensive personal relationship involving holiday socializing, helicopter transport offers, and Epstein as business intermediary.** The original assessment that "the verified evidence establishes a connection but does not document the nature or depth of any personal relationship" is superseded by this corpus evidence.

## SECTION 4: PETER DIAMANDIS (XPRIZE / Singularity University)

### 4.1 Evidence
- **[EFTA02139717](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA02139717.pdf)** (redactions): Peter Diamandis and Connie Fox in Epstein document, dated Wednesday, May 01, 2013 12:55 PM. Context: NYTimes Bestseller "Abundance - the Future..."
- **[EFTA02435081](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02435081.pdf)** (OCR): Epstein to Lisa Randall (Nov 30, 2009): "who is organizing.. is it diamandis?" -- regarding what appears to be a science/tech event
- **Significance**: Diamandis founded the XPRIZE, Singularity University, and Human Longevity Inc. (with Craig Venter). His documented connection to Epstein intersects transhumanism, longevity research, and tech entrepreneurship. The May 2013 date is post-conviction.
- **UPDATED (DS9/DS11 full corpus, 271 total documents):** Complete June 2014 scheduling chain ([EFTA00368190](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00368190.pdf)-[EFTA00368287](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00368287.pdf)) shows Diamandis emailing directly: "my only option would be to see Jeffrey between 1:30-2:30pm; or 2-3pm. How far is his home from the Empire Hotel where I'm staying?" Groff confirmed: "Peter Diamandis will come see you on Monday June 9th from 2-3pm." Same day: "7:30pm DINNER w/Peter Thiel and Ehud Barak." This transforms Diamandis from a name in 1 document to a fully documented in-person meeting at Epstein's 71st Street townhouse.

## SECTION 5: DANNY HILLIS / APPLIED MINDS INC. (EXPANDED)

### 5.1 Evidence (13+ Documents)
- **[EFTA02067004](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA02067004.pdf)/068140/068601/068608/068825/068946**: Multiple email headers showing "Applied Minds Inc. Hillis Danny" -- business correspondence
- **[EFTA01839936](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01839936.pdf)/02173981/02173990**: "Mtg w/Danny Hillis / Jeffrey Epstein" -- formal meeting arranged
- **[EFTA02194014](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA02194014.pdf)**: Applied Minds Inc. Hillis Danny with Alice Hargrove
- **[EFTA00005284](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%203/EFTA00005284.pdf)** (OCR): Photo/file index: "DANNY HILLIS-ZORRO" -- Hillis visited Zorro Ranch
- **[EFTA00013640](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00013640.pdf)** (OCR): Profile article: "Danny Hillis, an MIT-educated computer scientist whose company, Thinking Machines, was at the forefront of the supercomputing world in the eighties... thinks Epstein is actually using scientific knowledge to beat the markets. 'We talk about currency tradi[ng]...'"
- **[EFTA00013640](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00013640.pdf)** continued: "He has changed my life. Because of his support, I feel I can do anything I want." (attributed to a scientist discussing Epstein)

### 5.2 Significance
Hillis is now documented with:
- 13+ EFTA documents spanning years
- A formal scheduled meeting with Epstein
- A visit to Zorro Ranch (confirmed by photo index)
- Active business correspondence through Applied Minds Inc.
- Direct quotes praising Epstein's support
- Applied Minds Inc. is a defense/intelligence technology company that has done work for DARPA and the military, making the Hillis-Epstein connection particularly significant.

## SECTION 6: NATHAN MYHRVOLD (Intellectual Ventures / ex-Microsoft CTO)

### 6.1 Evidence (3 Documents)
- **[EFTA01786113](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01786113.pdf)**: "Nathan Myhrvold; Wayt Gib[son]" -- in email or contact list
- **[EFTA01884202](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01884202.pdf)**: "Greetings from Nathan Myhrvold's office" -- his office reaching out to Epstein
- **[EFTA02156472](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA02156472.pdf)**: "coming at 4:30! Not Myhrvold" -- scheduling discussion referencing Myhrvold's expected visit

### 6.2 Significance
Myhrvold (former CTO of Microsoft, founder of Intellectual Ventures) had documented communication with Epstein. "Greetings from Nathan Myhrvold's office" indicates an organizational-level relationship, not just casual contact. Myhrvold has faced separate allegations of sexual misconduct (reported by the NYT in 2019). His patent aggregation company Intellectual Ventures was controversial for its aggressive IP strategy.

## SECTION 12: WHAT WAS NOT FOUND (NEGATIVE RESULTS)

The following search terms returned **ZERO relevant results** across all document collections:

### Companies/Organizations - NO HITS:
| Search Term | Significance |
|------------|-------------|
| Kernel (Bryan Johnson) | Brain-computer interface company |
| Neuralink | Musk's neural interface company |
| DARPA | Defense research agency |
| Defense Advanced | Same |
| In-Q-Tel | CIA venture capital |
| Palantir | Thiel's data analytics |
| CRISPR | Gene editing technology |
| gene therapy | Medical technology |
| gene editing | Same |
| synthetic biology | Emerging biotech field |
| life extension | Longevity organization |
| cryopreservation | Cryonics technology |
| Alcor | Cryonics organization |
| OpenAI | AI research organization |
| DeepMind | Google AI |
| Cold Spring Harbor | Genetics research institution |
| Allen Institute | Brain science institution |
| Woods Hole | Oceanographic institution |
| Scripps Research | Biomedical institution |
| clinical trial | Pharmaceutical research |

### People - NO HITS:
| Search Term | Significance |
|------------|-------------|
| Bryan Johnson | Kernel founder, longevity |
| Ray Kurzweil | Google AI, Singularity [**PARTIAL UPDATE:** appears on Barnaby Marsh's 92nd St Y talent list ([EFTA02343458](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02343458.pdf)) as "FUTURIST" -- was a target of Epstein's network even if no direct communication was captured] |
| Aubrey de Grey | SENS Foundation, anti-aging |
| Craig Venter | Human Genome Project [**PARTIAL UPDATE:** appears on Marsh's 92nd St Y list as "GENETICS PIONEER" -- was a target of the network] |
| David Sabatini | MIT Biology (later fired for misconduct) |
| Charles Lieber | Harvard Chemistry (arrested for China ties) |
| Esther Dyson | Tech investor, futurist |
| Stewart Brand | Whole Earth Catalog |
| Kevin Kelly | Wired co-founder |
| Daniel Dennett | Tufts philosopher |
| Sam Harris | Neuroscientist/author |
| Demis Hassabis | DeepMind founder |

### Assessment of Negative Results
The negative results are significant because they establish **boundaries** of Epstein's documented network:

1. **No direct DARPA/DoD/In-Q-Tel connection found** -- Despite Hillis's defense work through Applied Minds, no direct military/intelligence R&D funding connection through Epstein is documented.

2. **No CRISPR/gene editing/gene therapy documents** -- While Epstein discussed genetics conceptually (transhumanism, eugenics, "perfecting the genome"), there is no evidence of investment in specific gene editing companies or technologies.

3. **No direct cryonics organization connection** -- Despite Epstein telling people he wanted his "head and penis frozen," there is no documented Alcor membership or cryonics company investment.

4. **No OpenAI/DeepMind/modern AI company connection** -- Epstein's AI interests remained at the academic/research level (Bach, MIT Media Lab) rather than extending to commercial AI companies.

5. **No Cold Spring Harbor connection** -- Significant given Cold Spring Harbor's historical association with eugenics research and Epstein's documented eugenics interests.

6. **Sam Harris returned ZERO** -- Despite being discussed in Brockman-Epstein email ([EFTA02501737](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02501737.pdf), already known), Harris does not appear independently in any redaction or OCR record.

## SECTION 15: CONCLUSIONS

### 15.1 The Science Network Was Larger Than Previously Known
This investigation adds **12 named individuals** and **3 institutional connections** to the documented Epstein science network. The "Physics of the Universe" Summit alone adds 40+ names of world-class physicists to the list of scientists who participated in Epstein-organized events post-conviction.

### 15.2 Epstein's Role Was Active, Not Passive
The documents show Epstein was not merely a donor or dinner host. He was:
- **Brokering introductions** (Bach into MIT, Diamandis events, Simons via Marsh)
- **Managing trusts** (Chomsky's marital trusts)
- **Organizing elite conferences** (SpaceX/Caltech summit)
- **Trading biotech stocks** (Nasdaq Biotechnology Index charts)
- **Developing Gates Foundation proposals** (BMGF document with Roed-Larsen)
- **Funding travel** (Bach from Berlin, Gershenfeld, Nowak)

### 15.3 The Templeton Foundation Connection Is Potentially the Most Significant New Finding
Barnaby Marsh's role as a Templeton Foundation officer who was simultaneously a regular in Epstein's science circle represents a potential funding pipeline that has not been investigated. The Templeton Foundation awards over $200M annually in science grants. Whether any Templeton funding decisions were influenced by the Marsh-Epstein relationship requires further investigation.

### 15.4 The Musk-Epstein Relationship Is Now Extensively Documented
**UPDATED (full-text corpus revisit):** The original assessment that "the nature and extent remain partially documented" is superseded. DS11 contains 15+ direct email exchanges (2012-2015) revealing an extensive personal relationship including holiday socializing in BVI/St. Barths, helicopter transport offers to Epstein's island, Musk asking about "the wildest party on your island," and Epstein serving as business intermediary between Musk and Sultan bin Sulayem. See Section 3.3 above for the complete email timeline. The NTOC tip mentioning Musk remains unverified and is separate from this documented correspondence.

### 15.5 Previously Undocumented Figure: Misha Gromov (Abel Prize Mathematician)
**NEW (full-text corpus revisit):** Misha Gromov (Mikhail Gromov, Abel Prize 2009) appears in 1,627 documents (920 DS9 + 707 DS11) but was not mentioned in the original report. He flew on Epstein's aircraft ([EFTA00285128](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00285128.pdf): "JE to fly Misha Gromov with him"), was picked up from his apartment for trips to Harvard ([EFTA00293613](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00293613.pdf): "8:45am Jojo to pick up Misha Gromov from his apartment... Misha Gromov to fly with Jeffrey"), and recruited Leon Peshkin into the network. A December 5, 2015 gathering at Nowak's Institute included Chomsky, Gromov, Hillis, Nowak, and Church simultaneously.

### 15.6 DS9 Calendar Documents Reveal Full Operational Cadence
**NEW (full-text corpus revisit):** DS9 daily calendars reveal the precise operational patterns of the science network. A typical Harvard trip: fly Boston morning, meet Nowak at 1 Brattle Square, lunch with Church, dinner with Chomsky/Bach cluster, return same day. Science meetings were interleaved with Leon Black, Jes Staley, Brad Wechsler, and other financial/legal contacts in the same day/week. Calendar entries show: Barnaby Marsh at 7am SKYPE calls, Joscha Bach in apartment 11B, George Church lunches at Harvard Medical School, Chomsky dinners, Hillis visits, and Diamandis at Epstein's home.

### 15.7 The AI/Cognitive Science Pipeline Was Real But Academic
Epstein's AI interests manifested through academic researchers (Bach's cognitive architectures, Slavin's algorithms, Liebermann's MIT group) rather than commercial AI companies. No evidence of OpenAI, DeepMind, or commercial AI investment was found.
