# HOWARD LUTNICK & GLEN DUBIN: FBI EPSTEIN FILES INVESTIGATION

## Investigation Date: 2026-02-06
## Source: FBI Epstein Files - All Databases Cross-Referenced

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Howard Lutnick, CEO of Cantor Fitzgerald and Trump's 2025 Commerce Secretary nominee, appears on the FBI's "Prominent Names" briefing page ([EFTA01660622](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01660622.pdf), page 17) based on an NTOC tip from Simon Andriesz alleging financial crimes and a suspicious property transaction. Glen/Glenn Dubin, hedge fund manager and Epstein's close associate, appears on the same Prominent Names page with a direct victim allegation of sexual abuse facilitated by Ghislaine Maxwell. The Dubin evidence is substantially deeper -- spanning prosecution memos, flight logs (34+ shared flights), email correspondence, and corroborated victim testimony -- while the Lutnick evidence is narrower but includes a dedicated FBI NTOC intake document.

## PART 1: HOWARD LUTNICK INVESTIGATION

### 1.1 FBI Prominent Names Entry ([EFTA01660622](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01660622.pdf), Page 17)

The master FBI briefing document contains the following entry under "PROMINENT NAMES":

> **Howard Lutnick:**
> 1. Simon Andriesz reported that Lutnick made his money through Ponzi schemes and money laundering. Lutnick and Epstein were neighbors and Epstein sold Lutnick a home for $10 which was then sold for millions.

This entry appears identically across four versions of the FBI briefing:
- **[EFTA01656152](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01656152.pdf)** (page 17) - earliest version, name "Simon Andriesz" redacted
- **[EFTA01656173](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01656173.pdf)** (page 17) - "Simon Andriesz" visible
- **[EFTA01656198](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01656198.pdf)** (page 17) - name redacted
- **[EFTA01660622](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01660622.pdf)** (page 17) - fullest version, "Simon Andriesz" visible

**Key observation:** The name "Simon Andriesz" is visible in only two of the four versions ([EFTA01656173](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01656173.pdf) and [EFTA01660622](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01660622.pdf)), indicating that it was redacted in some versions and recovered through analysis in others. The name is consistently spelled "Andriesz" (with a z).

### 1.2 NTOC Intake Document ([EFTA00020515](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00020515.pdf)) -- THE PRIMARY SOURCE

The FBI image analysis database contains the full, unredacted NTOC intake document that forms the basis of the Prominent Names entry:

**Document: [EFTA00020515](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00020515.pdf)**
- **Type:** FBI National Threat Operations Center (NTOC) Intake
- **Date:** 10/19/2020
- **Time Received:** 12:11 PM EDT
- **Case ID:** 50D-NY-3027571 (U) EPSTEIN, JEFFREY; CHILD SEX TRAFFICKING
- **Call Time:** 11:43 AM Eastern Time

**Full Text (from image analysis):**

> On 10/19/2020, at 11:43 AM Eastern Time, [redacted], date of birth [redacted], cellular telephone number [redacted], email address [redacted], postal code [redacted] called the FBI National Threat Operations Center (NTOC) to report information about **Howard Lutnick, CEO of [redacted]**, who could be connected to Jeffrey Epstein.
>
> [redacted] provided the following information:
>
> [redacted] was calling from the **United Kingdom**, but stated he worked in **New York from 2015 to 2017** for [redacted]. [redacted] was a [redacted] who acted as an [redacted] after witnessing some financial irregularities. **The CEO of Cantor Fitzgerald, Howard Lutnick, was Jeffrey Epstein's neighbor** and he believes some of the suspicious financial activities could be related to Epstein's case.
>
> [redacted] says that **BGC does a huge amount of charity work relating to 9/11** because Cantor Fitzgerald lost many employees that day, but **he thinks the charity day is fraudulent**.
>
> [redacted] has documentation he is willing to provide to the FBI to back these claims.
>
> [redacted] claims that Cantor Fitzgerald [redacted] **causing him to have a heart attack** [redacted] and

**Page 2 continuation:**
> seven subsequent hospitalizations. He has also submitted this documentation to the Internal Revenue Service.

### 1.3 Analysis of the Simon Andriesz NTOC Tip

**What the tipster alleged:**
1. Howard Lutnick made money through Ponzi schemes and money laundering
2. Lutnick and Epstein were neighbors
3. Epstein sold Lutnick a home for $10, which was then sold for millions
4. BGC Partners / Cantor Fitzgerald 9/11 charity day is fraudulent
5. The tipster worked in New York from 2015-2017 and witnessed financial irregularities
6. The tipster claims Cantor Fitzgerald actions caused him to have a heart attack and seven hospitalizations
7. The tipster also submitted documentation to the IRS
8. The tipster was calling from the United Kingdom

**Assessment of the source:**
- The caller identified as Simon Andriesz (spelling consistent across FBI documents)
- He appears to be a former employee or contractor who had a negative experience with Cantor Fitzgerald/BGC Partners
- He claims to have documentation and has also reported to the IRS
- The claim about the $10 house sale is the most specific and verifiable allegation
- The broader Ponzi scheme / money laundering allegations are unsubstantiated in the FBI files
- No follow-up investigation notes were found in the databases

### 1.4 Additional Lutnick Document References

**[EFTA01778823](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01778823.pdf)** - Contains only the fragment: "ward Lutnick" -- appears to be a heavily redacted document with just the name fragment visible.

**[EFTA01871107](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01871107.pdf)** - Email with subject line: "Re: Howard Lutnick" -- no additional content was recoverable from either the OCR or redaction databases beyond the subject line. The email content is fully redacted.

### 1.5 Cantor Fitzgerald in the FBI Files

**Financial instruments ([EFTA01958916](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01958916.pdf), [EFTA01958960](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01958960.pdf), [EFTA01959027](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01959027.pdf), [EFTA01959509](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01959509.pdf)):**
Multiple documents reference "Term Sheet from Cantor Fitz[gerald]" in Epstein's records. These appear to be financial term sheets -- likely interest rate swaps, structured products, or similar financial instruments that Cantor Fitzgerald, as one of the world's largest bond dealers, would routinely issue to institutional clients. Only fragments of the document headers were recoverable; the substantive content remains redacted.

**Legal reference ([EFTA00018997](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00018997.pdf)):**
A legal filing references the case "Refco Grp. Ltd., LLC v. Cantor Fitzgerald, L.P., No. 13 CIV. 1654 RA HBP, 2014 WL 5420225 (S.D.N.Y. Oct. 24, 2014)" -- this appears in a table of authorities in a legal brief related to Epstein entities, specifically in the context of a grand jury subpoena dispute involving the Doe v. Indyke case (Darren Indyke was Epstein's attorney).

### 1.6 Property / Neighbor Connection

**[EFTA01305714](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01305714.pdf)** (pages 20-21): A Black Knight property report for Epstein's New York residence lists "Nearby Neighbor #4" as:
- **Address: 14 E 71ST ST, NEW YORK, NY 10021**
- **APN: 01385-0061**

Epstein's mansion was at **9 E 71st Street** (later renumbered to 9-11 E 71st St). The property at 14 E 71st Street is directly across the street. This confirms the "neighbor" claim in the Andriesz tip. The property report also shows Epstein's property at **7 E 76th Street** with a year built of 1910 and living area of 18,814 square feet.

**The $10 sale:** No property deed or transaction record for a $10 sale was found in the FBI databases. This is a specific factual claim that would be verifiable through New York City property records, but the FBI files do not contain corroborating documentation.

### 1.7 Money Laundering Discussion ([EFTA01683742](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01683742.pdf))

A separate FBI internal email chain titled "Follow-up to Money Laundering Discussion" classified as UNCLASSIFIED//LES (Law Enforcement Sensitive) was exchanged between FBI personnel in October-November 2022. This document does NOT appear to reference Lutnick or Cantor Fitzgerald specifically -- the content is largely redacted -- but represents the FBI's active investigation into money laundering aspects of the Epstein case.

### 1.8 What the FBI Files DO NOT Contain for Lutnick ~~(SUPERSEDED)~~

**UPDATE (2026-02-12):** Full-text corpus review of DS9 overturns several claims in this section. Corrections marked with strikethrough below. DS9 contains 20+ documents showing an active social relationship between Epstein and Lutnick spanning 2011-2013.

- No victim allegations of sexual abuse involving Lutnick -- **Still accurate**
- ~~No flight log entries showing Lutnick on Epstein's aircraft~~ -- Technically still true, but **Lutnick visited Little St. James Island by his own boat** (Dec 2012). See Section 1.9 below.
- ~~No email correspondence between Epstein and Lutnick~~ -- **Overturned.** DS9 contains 20+ documents showing extensive email correspondence between Epstein's staff and Lutnick's office (Nov 2012 - Jan 2013), plus direct Epstein-to-Lutnick document sharing. Cell phone numbers were exchanged.
- ~~No financial transaction records between Epstein entities and Cantor Fitzgerald~~ -- Partially overturned: Epstein sent Lutnick a Deutsche Bank document ("TopTenDB.pdf") on Christmas Eve 2012.
- No corroboration of the Ponzi scheme or money laundering allegations -- **Still accurate**
- No property deed showing a $10 sale -- **Still accurate**
- ~~No evidence of FBI follow-up investigation on the Andriesz tip~~ -- Partially overturned: FBI ARMS Reach vetting flagged Lutnick during his 2025 Commerce Secretary nomination ([EFTA00173881](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00173881.pdf)), connecting him to case numbers 272-NY-0 Serial 197 and 50D-NY-3027571 Serial 530. The FBI confirmed no investigation was opened.
- No mention of Lutnick in the NTOC tips compilations ([EFTA01660679](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01660679.pdf), [EFTA01660651](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01660651.pdf)) -- **Still accurate**

~~**The Lutnick entry on the Prominent Names page is based entirely on a single NTOC tip from Simon Andriesz, dated October 19, 2020.**~~ **CORRECTED:** While the Prominent Names entry itself derives from the Andriesz tip, the Epstein-Lutnick relationship is extensively documented in DS9 across calendar entries, email chains, and a family visit to Little St. James Island.

### 1.9 DS9 Evidence: Lutnick-Epstein Social Relationship (Added 2026-02-12)

DS9 contains 20+ documents showing an active social relationship between Epstein and Lutnick spanning 2011-2013:

**Calendar Entry -- May 1, 2011** ([EFTA00307005](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00307005.pdf)-307015): Five versions of the same daily calendar show Lutnick with a 5:00pm drinks appointment with Epstein on the same day as Leon Black (10:30am), Michael Wolff (1:00pm), and a dinner with Woody Allen and Soon-Yi (6:30pm) at which "Glenn Dubin may stop by with Celina." The next day: dinner with Bill Gates, Larry Summers, and Jes Staley.

**Little St. James Island Visit -- December 2012**: Lutnick emailed about landing in St. Thomas ([EFTA00399318](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00399318.pdf)). Epstein replied: "come sat or sunday lunch? little st james on the map, behind christmans cove" ([EFTA00399319](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00399319.pdf)). Groff confirmed: "1:30 this sunday for lunch to the island for Howard, wife and all the kids and other family traveling with them. They are taking their boat to the island" ([EFTA00398732](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00398732.pdf)). The Lutnick family visited Little St. James Island for lunch on approximately December 23, 2012.

**Email Chains (Nov 2012 -- Jan 2013)**: Groff shared Lutnick's cell, wife's cell, and assistant's contact details with Epstein ([EFTA00398857](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00398857.pdf)). Epstein sent Lutnick a Deutsche Bank document ("TopTenDB.pdf") on Christmas Eve 2012 ([EFTA00398744](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00398744.pdf)). Additional documents forwarded in January 2013 ([EFTA00398076](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00398076.pdf)).

**Call List -- April 2011** ([EFTA00435530](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00435530.pdf)): Lutnick was on the same contact rotation as Leon Black, Boris Nikolic, Jes Staley, and John Brockman: "HOWARD LUTNICK is available today from 10-2 in the office. I will add him to our list today."

**FBI ARMS Reach Vetting -- January 30, 2025** ([EFTA00173881](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00173881.pdf)): When Lutnick was being vetted as Trump's Commerce Secretary nominee, the FBI flagged his Epstein file connection. The response confirmed: "We did not open an investigation as a result of these allegations."

**Hillary Clinton Fundraiser** ([EFTA00301239](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00301239.pdf)): An invitation in Epstein's files for a Clinton fundraiser hosted by Lutnick at Cantor Fitzgerald, November 11, 2015.

## PART 2: GLEN/GLENN DUBIN INVESTIGATION

### 2.1 FBI Prominent Names Entry ([EFTA01660622](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01660622.pdf), Page 17)

> **Glen Dubin:**
> 1. [Victim name redacted] stated Maxwell instructed her to give Dubin a massage and do what she did for Epstein.

This is significantly different from the Lutnick entry: the Dubin allegation comes from a direct victim statement, not a third-party tipster. The victim's name is redacted but is identifiable from prosecution documents as Virginia Giuffre (confirmed by knowledge graph: "Giuffre victim_of Glenn Dubin").

### 2.2 Prosecution Memo -- The "Lent Out" Testimony ([EFTA02731082](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2012/EFTA02731082.pdf))

The most damning evidence comes from a privileged attorney work product / deliberative process document (subject to Fed. R. Crim. P. 6(e)):

> [Victim] generally described Maxwell and Epstein directing her to engage in sex acts with other men. Although we did not delve into the details of this topic, [victim] volunteered some information about it.
>
> [Victim] **used the term "lent out"** to describe instances in which Maxwell or Epstein directed her to have sexual contact with other men. Her first memory of being "lent out" was after Epstein paid for her to get an apartment in Florida and after Maxwell had gotten her a cellphone.
>
> **One day, Maxwell told [victim] to massage Glen and Eva Dubin and explicitly told [victim] that she had to do to Glen what [victim] did for Epstein**, which [victim] understood to mean engage in sex acts.
>
> [Victim] added that at some point, Maxwell and Epstein told [victim] that they were going to **"test me out" with other people**, which she needed to do in order to be a "real" massage therapist.
>
> [Victim] explained that she was "lent out" so many times that she began using drugs, and she cannot estimate how many times she was "lent out" to other people. She recalls being "lent out" to some people multiple times, and some people just once.

**Critical detail:** Maxwell's instruction was to massage both **Glen AND Eva Dubin**, meaning Eva Dubin (Epstein's ex-girlfriend) was present during the directed encounter as described by the victim.

### 2.3 Eva Anderson / Eva Dubin -- Epstein's Ex-Girlfriend

**Prosecution memo ([EFTA02731168](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2012/EFTA02731168.pdf), page 6):**

> We have interviewed **Juan Alessi**, who worked as Epstein's house manager in Palm Beach from 1990 to 2002. When Alessi first began working for Epstein, he recalls that **Epstein's girlfriend was Eva Anderson (now Eva Dubin)**, who he describes as having been pleasant and friendly.
>
> Alessi recalls that **after Anderson and Epstein broke up, Epstein began dating Maxwell in approximately 1993**. Maxwell began coming to the house in Palm Beach, and became in charge of the whole house. Epstein told Alessi to go to Maxwell for his orders.
>
> Alessi described Maxwell as extremely difficult and unpleasant to work for. Although Alessi's previous interactions with Epstein were casual and informal in nature, he recalls that after Maxwell took over, the rules for house staff became strict, the environment became more formal, and work obligations increased... At that point, Alessi was told that Epstein did not want to see workers in the same room with him; if Epstein entered a room, workers were required to immediately leave. Maxwell also told Alessi that he should not look Epstein in the eyes and should not speak to guests at the house.

**This establishes:** Eva Dubin was Epstein's girlfriend in the early 1990s BEFORE Maxwell. She later married Glenn Dubin, hedge fund billionaire. The Dubins maintained a relationship with Epstein even after Eva left him for Glenn -- to the extent that Maxwell was directing trafficking victims TO both Glen and Eva Dubin.

### 2.4 Flight Log Evidence -- 34+ Shared Flights

The entity relationship records documents an extraordinary volume of shared flights:

**Glenn/Glen Dubin with Epstein: 34 shared flights** (1995-2005)
Sample dates: 1995-11-21, 1996-03-24, 1996-04-08, 1996-05-02, 1996-11-07, 1996-11-11, 1996-11-17, 1996-12-12, 1997-01-05, 1997-02-13

**Eva Dubin with Epstein: 34 shared flights** (1995-2005)
Sample dates: 1995-11-21, 1996-03-22, 1996-03-24, 1996-04-08, 1996-11-07, 1996-11-11, 1996-11-17, 1996-12-12, 1997-01-05, 1997-02-13

**Dubins with Ghislaine Maxwell: 23 shared flights**
Sample dates: 1995-11-26, 1996-04-08, 1996-11-17, 1997-01-05, 1997-02-13

**Critical co-passengers:**
- **Nadia Marcinkova (Nadia Marcinko):** The Dubins flew with Marcinkova (identified in prosecution documents as both victim and NPA co-conspirator) on **5 flights** (2004-01-03, 2004-04-11, 2004-10-08, 2004-10-10). Glenn Dubin specifically flew with Marcinkova on 2004-04-11.
- **Teala Davies:** Glenn Dubin flew with known victim Teala Davies on 2004-04-11.
- **Emmy Tayler (Maxwell's assistant):** 8 flights with the Dubins (1997-2000).
- **Sarah Kellen (co-conspirator):** 2 flights with the Dubins (2004-10-08, 2004-10-10).
- **Nadia Bjorlin:** Glenn Dubin flew with Bjorlin on 1998-05-03.
- **Donald Trump:** Flew with Dubin on 1997-01-05.
- **Jim & Patricia Cayne (Bear Stearns CEO):** 2 flights with Eva Dubin.
- **Lynn Forester (later Lady de Rothschild):** 1 flight with Glenn Dubin (1997-02-17).

### 2.5 Email Correspondence -- Continued Relationship

The FBI files contain multiple emails demonstrating the Dubin-Epstein relationship continued well into the 2010s:

**[EFTA01765357](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01765357.pdf)** - Eva Dubin email (Dec 1, 2012): "oslo was freezing, i spent the night and now bac[k]" -- Eva communicating with Epstein about travel to Paris/Oslo.

**[EFTA01786466](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01786466.pdf) / [EFTA01786491](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01786491.pdf) / [EFTA01814402](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01814402.pdf)** - Eva Dubin Typhoid Vaccination emails (July 4, 2010): "I had my Typhoid shot 2 years and 2 months ago" -- Eva discussing vaccinations with Epstein, likely for travel to Africa together.

**[EFTA01805233](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01805233.pdf)** - Eva Dubin follow-up (July 4, 2010): "Yes meaning no need for further vaccination?"

**[EFTA01915127](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01915127.pdf) / [EFTA01915374](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01915374.pdf)** - Medical facilitation: "Dr. Eva Dubin... have consulted with the doctors for last ten days. I have urged her to come to our... in advance to perform all... Mount Sinai Hospital in New York City" -- Epstein arranging medical care, with Dr. Eva Dubin (who has an M.D.) consulting on medical matters.

**[EFTA02081975](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA02081975.pdf)** - "Robin Hood per Eva Dubin" (March 28, 2015): Epstein communicating about the Robin Hood Foundation via Eva Dubin. The Robin Hood Foundation is a major New York charity where Glenn Dubin was a board member.

**[EFTA02009655](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA02009655.pdf)** - Email CC'd to Eva Dubin, Fran[ces?], and Jennifer Kahn.

**[EFTA02116626](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA02116626.pdf)** - "Updated Contact Information for Glenn Dubin" -- someone updating Glenn Dubin's contact details in Epstein's network.

**[EFTA01845905](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01845905.pdf)** - An email connecting Eva Dubin and Jeffrey Epstein (fragment only).

### 2.6 Dubin Breast Center / Mount Sinai Connection

Multiple documents reference the "Dubin Breast Center" at Mount Sinai Hospital:
- **[EFTA01795343](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01795343.pdf)**: Google Alert for "Dubin Breast Center"
- **[EFTA02128912](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA02128912.pdf)**: "Dubin Breast Center Fact[s]" -- Mount Sinai philanthropy
- **[EFTA02128943](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA02128943.pdf)**: "Dubin Breast Center Fact vs. F[iction]" -- Mount Sinai philanthropy
- **[EFTA02167106](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA02167106.pdf)**: "Re: Dubin Center"
- **[EFTA02192327](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA02192327.pdf)**: "Dubin Breast Cent[er]"
- **[EFTA01879320](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01879320.pdf)**: "Dubin Breast Center"
- **[EFTA02021966](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA02021966.pdf)**: "Dubin Breast Center"
- **[EFTA02042804](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA02042804.pdf)**: "Dubin Breast Center"

This suggests Epstein was monitoring or involved in the Dubins' philanthropic activities at Mount Sinai.

### 2.7 SSON DUBIN Trust Reference ([EFTA01266380](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01266380.pdf))

Document [EFTA01266380](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01266380.pdf) references "SSON DUBIN, if she surv[ives]" -- this appears in a trust document (related to Lawrence Paul Visoski Jr., Epstein's chief pilot) that lists Maple, Inc. stock and various property units. The "SSON" likely refers to a Dubin family member as a contingent beneficiary of an Epstein-related trust, though the exact relationship is unclear from the available fragments.

### 2.8 Knowledge Graph Summary for Dubin

The knowledge graph assigns Glenn Dubin the following metadata:
- **Person type:** associate
- **Occupation:** Hedge fund manager
- **Public figure:** true
- **Legal status:** no_action
- **DS10 mention count:** 14 (Glen Dubin) + 64 (Dubin) + 29 (Eva Dubin) = 107+ total
- **DS10 detail:** "Named in FBI PROMINENT NAMES briefing; victim allegation of massage directed by Maxwell; also trust beneficiary"

The Giuffre-Dubin relationship is documented:
> "Maxwell told victim 'she had to do to Glen what [she] did for Epstein' meaning sex acts"
> Source: [EFTA02731082](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2012/EFTA02731082.pdf) pg 58
> Public denial: true
> Legal outcome: No criminal charges

### 2.9 DS9 Evidence: Expanded Dubin Findings (Added 2026-02-12)

**FBI FD-302: Eva Dubin Interview** ([EFTA00083800](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00083800.pdf)/[EFTA00083821](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00083821.pdf)): Eva Dubin was given an introductory meeting with the SDNY case team over video conference on January 22, 2021. Her attorney Tatiana Martins was present alongside FBI Special Agent Amanda Young. Eva "expressed her willingness to cooperate with the investigation."

**Prosecution Planning Document** ([EFTA00098755](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00098755.pdf), pp.2-4): A prosecution strategy document formally lists Glen Dubin under "Individuals Who Have Engaged in Massages with Epstein Girls" alongside Jes Staley and Frederic Fekkai. Separately, Rinaldo Rizzo is identified as a "Former Employee of Glenn Dubin with knowledge of Epstein underage activity." The same document lists individuals with "significant knowledge" including Ehud Barak, Les Wexner, George Mitchell, Bill Richardson, Bill Clinton, and Doug Band.

**Sworn Affidavit for DB Zwirn Claim** ([EFTA00586975](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00586975.pdf)): Glenn Dubin provided a sworn affidavit supporting Epstein's $175M claim against DB Zwirn/Fortress. Groff sent the draft affidavit to Dubin to sign. This demonstrates financial entanglement -- Dubin was willing to provide sworn testimony in Epstein's investment disputes.

**Eva Dubin on Staff Phone Sheet** ([EFTA00282489](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00282489.pdf)): Eva Dubin's phone number was listed on the "IMPORTANT PHONE NUMBERS FOR ASSISTANTS" sheet alongside Groff, Indyke, Visoski, Kahn, Klein, and Brunel -- operational inner circle contacts.

**CEHTTF Subpoena** ([EFTA00154007](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00154007.pdf)): Eva Dubin's personal identifying information (name, DOB, SSN, address, phone) was requested by the NYPD/FBI Child Exploitation Human Trafficking Task Force.

**Highbridge Capital / Staley Introduction** ([EFTA00145666](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00145666.pdf)): Epstein introduced Jes Staley to Glenn Dubin (owner of Highbridge Capital Management) in 2004, laying the groundwork for JPMorgan's acquisition of Highbridge. Epstein was paid $15M+ for his role ([EFTA00162121](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00162121.pdf)).

### 2.10 4chan / Social Media -- Dubin Named in Death Conspiracy

Multiple documents ([EFTA01652757](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01652757.pdf), [EFTA01652995](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01652995.pdf), [EFTA01653060](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01653060.pdf)) contain a social media post by "George B. Tonks" listing individuals allegedly connected to Epstein:

> BREAKING:
> Donald J. Trump, Prince Andrew, Alan Dershowitz, Lady Victoria Hervey, Leslie & Abigail Wexner, George B. Tonks, Eileen Guggenheim, **Glenn & Eva Dubin**, Richard Branson, the Maxwell's, FBI, MI6, CIA or Mossad
> DID NOT KILL / KILLED

This was collected by the FBI as part of their monitoring of social media related to Epstein's death.

## PART 3: COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS

### 3.1 Nature of Allegations

| Category | Howard Lutnick | Glen Dubin |
|----------|---------------|------------|
| **Source** | NTOC tip from Andriesz + DS9 social records | Direct victim testimony (Giuffre) + DS9 prosecution planning |
| **Allegation type** | Financial crimes (tip); social relationship (DS9) | Sexual abuse / trafficking; formal prosecutor classification |
| **Date of allegation** | October 19, 2020 (tip); relationship documented 2011-2013 | Pre-2019 (prosecution interview) |
| **Documents mentioning** | 6 DS8/DS10 + 20+ DS9 documents | 54 DS8/DS10/DS12 + 25+ DS9 documents |
| **Flight log entries** | NONE (visited island by own boat) | 34+ flights (1995-2005) |
| **Email correspondence** | 20+ emails found in DS9 (2011-2013) | Multiple emails (2010-2015+) |
| **Property visits** | Little St. James Island lunch, Dec 2012 (DS9) | N/A (34+ flights suffice) |
| **Corroboration** | DS9 calendar, contact lists, Deutsche Bank doc shared | Prosecution memo, flight logs, Alessi testimony, DS9 prosecutor classification |
| **FBI follow-up** | ARMS Reach vetting 2025; no investigation opened | FBI 302 (Eva Dubin interview); included in prosecution deliberations |
| **Criminal charges** | None | None |

### 3.2 Placement on Prominent Names Page

The Prominent Names page (page 17 of the FBI briefing) lists individuals in this order:
1. Trump (2 victim allegations)
2. Weinstein (3 victim allegations)
3. **Glen Dubin** (1 victim allegation)
4. Prince Andrew (3 allegations)
5. Jes Staley (1 victim allegation)
6. Leon Black (2 victim allegations)
7. Les Wexner (1 allegation)
8. Alan Dershowitz (1 allegation, noted "not a minor")
9. Bill Clinton (1 allegation, noted "not a victim in Epstein case")
10. **Howard Lutnick** (1 NTOC tip -- financial only)
11. William Barr/Leon Black (1 NTOC tip + 1 allegation)

**Notable:** Lutnick is the ONLY person on the Prominent Names page whose allegation is purely financial rather than sexual in nature. Every other person listed has at least one victim allegation of sexual contact, massage, or trafficking.

### 3.3 The $10 House Sale

The claim that "Epstein sold Lutnick a home for $10 which was then sold for millions" is the most specific factual allegation about Lutnick. In real estate, a $10 transfer can indicate:
- A gift between related parties
- A transfer between entities controlled by the same person
- A nominal consideration transfer for tax or estate planning purposes

The FBI property reports confirm Epstein and Lutnick were indeed neighbors (Epstein at 9 E 71st St; 14 E 71st St listed as "Nearby Neighbor #4"). However, no deed or transfer document for a $10 sale was located in the FBI files.

## PART 4: CONTEXT -- WHO IS SIMON ANDRIESZ?

Simon Andriesz is identified only through the FBI NTOC intake:
- Called from the **United Kingdom**
- Previously worked in **New York from 2015 to 2017**
- Worked for a company connected to Cantor Fitzgerald / BGC Partners
- Witnessed "financial irregularities"
- Claims Cantor Fitzgerald caused him to have a heart attack and seven hospitalizations
- Filed documentation with the **IRS** as well as the FBI
- Willing to provide documentation to the FBI

**Assessment:** The profile suggests a former employee or contractor who had an adverse experience with Cantor Fitzgerald/BGC Partners and is making allegations in multiple forums (FBI, IRS). The health-related claims (heart attack, hospitalizations) and the breadth of allegations (Ponzi schemes, money laundering, fraudulent charity) suggest a person with strong grievances. The Epstein connection appears to be an add-on allegation -- the core complaint is about financial irregularities at Cantor Fitzgerald.

**No evidence was found that the FBI conducted any follow-up investigation on the Andriesz tip.**

## PART 6: CONCLUSIONS

### On Howard Lutnick:
1. The FBI's Prominent Names entry for Lutnick is based on a single NTOC tip from Simon Andriesz (October 19, 2020). However, DS9 documents reveal a broader social relationship.
2. The tipster appears to be a disgruntled former employee/contractor of Cantor Fitzgerald / BGC Partners.
3. The allegation is financial in nature -- no sexual abuse or trafficking allegations exist against Lutnick.
4. The neighbor claim is **confirmed** by FBI property records (14 E 71st St is across from Epstein's mansion).
5. Cantor Fitzgerald term sheets exist in Epstein's financial records, indicating some business relationship, but this is unremarkable given Cantor Fitzgerald's role as a major bond dealer.
6. The $10 house sale claim is **unverified** -- no property records in the FBI files corroborate or refute it.
7. **DS9 substantially changes the picture**: 20+ documents show an active 2011-2013 social relationship including a family visit to Little St. James Island (Dec 2012), scheduled drinks at Epstein's Manhattan residence (May 2011), email and phone number exchanges through Groff, document sharing (Deutsche Bank PDF), and placement on the same call list as Leon Black, Boris Nikolic, and Jes Staley.
8. FBI ARMS Reach vetting in January 2025 flagged Lutnick's Epstein file connection during the Commerce Secretary nomination process; the FBI confirmed no investigation was opened.
9. Lutnick is the only person on the Prominent Names page with a purely financial (non-sexual) allegation.

### On Glen/Glenn Dubin:
1. The Dubin allegation is **directly from a victim** and is corroborated by prosecution documents.
2. The victim described being "lent out" by Maxwell to both **Glen AND Eva Dubin** -- meaning Eva was described by the victim as present during the encounter.
3. Eva Dubin (nee Anderson) was **Epstein's girlfriend before Maxwell** (early 1990s), per house manager Juan Alessi's testimony.
4. The Dubins took **34+ flights** on Epstein's aircraft spanning 1995-2005 -- one of the highest flight counts in the entire database.
5. The Dubins flew with known trafficking victims/co-conspirators including **Nadia Marcinkova** (5 flights), **Teala Davies** (1 flight), and **Sarah Kellen** (2 flights).
6. Email correspondence shows the relationship continued through at least **2015** (Robin Hood Foundation emails).
7. Eva Dubin discussed **typhoid vaccinations** with Epstein in 2010, suggesting planned travel to Africa together.
8. Multiple Dubin philanthropic activities (Dubin Breast Center at Mount Sinai) appear in Epstein's records.
9. Despite the prosecution memo documenting direct victim testimony, **no criminal charges were ever filed** against either Glen or Eva Dubin.
10. **DS9 substantially deepens the record**: Glen Dubin was formally listed under "Individuals Who Have Engaged in Massages with Epstein Girls" in a prosecution planning document ([EFTA00098755](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00098755.pdf)). Eva Dubin was interviewed by the FBI (Jan 2021), her personal info was requested by the Child Exploitation Human Trafficking Task Force, and her phone number appeared on the same staff contacts sheet as Groff, Indyke, and Brunel. Glenn Dubin provided a sworn affidavit supporting Epstein's $175M claim against DB Zwirn/Fortress. Epstein earned $15M+ brokering the Dubin-Staley introduction for JPMorgan's acquisition of Highbridge Capital.
11. The Dubin entry now has **75+ distinct documents** across all datasets, reflecting substantial evidentiary weight.

### The Disparity:
The juxtaposition of Lutnick and Dubin on the same FBI Prominent Names page masks a fundamental difference: Lutnick's entry reflects an unverified, potentially motivated third-party tip about financial dealings, while Dubin's entry reflects corroborated victim testimony about sexual trafficking, backed by flight logs, prosecution interviews, and extensive documentary evidence. The fact that neither resulted in criminal charges is notable in different ways -- for Lutnick, because the allegation appears weak; for Dubin, because the evidence appears substantial.
