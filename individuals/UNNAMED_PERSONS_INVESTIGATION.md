## PART 1: [EFTA00022133](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00022133.pdf) -- THE VICTIM ACCUSATION COMPILATION

### Overview
[EFTA00022133](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00022133.pdf) is a 9-page internal compilation of victim accusations against Jeffrey Epstein, sourced from press reporting, hearing transcripts, and legal filings. It contains OCR text across 9 pages (IDs 2050, 9718, 14082, 17582, 20457, 21895, 32131, 37722, 38735) plus 32 redacted elements in primary document text database and 20 in Dataset 10 document text database.

### The Critical Passage (Page 5, OCR ID 17582)

The key passage names the unnamed individuals. It concerns Virginia Giuffre (referred to as "MBB" in the redacted OCR):

> "MBB also alleges Epstein and Maxwell told her to have sex with former New Mexico governor Bill Richardson; former Democratic Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell; the late MIT computer scientist Marvin Minsky; and MC2 model agency cofounder Jean Luc Brunel, as well as an unnamed **'prince,'** **'foreign president,'** and **owner of 'a French hotel chain.'** [She] previously alleged she had been forced by Epstein and Maxwell to have sex with lawyer Alan Dershowitz and Britain's Prince Andrew."

Additional details from the same page:
- "Had sex with Prince Andrew 3 times"
- "Epstein directed her to have sex with Glen Dubin"
- "Had sex with Dershowitz at least 6 times, aged 16-19"

### Cross-Reference: Jane Doe #3 Filing ([EFTA00021553](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00021553.pdf))

The legal filing in [EFTA00021553](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00021553.pdf) (Case 9:08-cv-80736-KAM, filed 01/02/2015) provides the broader context:

> "Epstein also trafficked Jane Doe #3 for sexual purposes to many other powerful men, including numerous **prominent American politicians, powerful business executives, foreign presidents, a well-known Prime Minister, and other world leaders.** Epstein required Jane Doe #3 to describe the events that she had with these men so that he could potentially blackmail them."

This establishes that the "foreign president" referenced in [EFTA00022133](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00022133.pdf) is one of multiple foreign leaders identified in Giuffre's sworn testimony.

---

## PART 2: IDENTIFICATION OF THE "FOREIGN PRESIDENT"

### Evidence

1. **[EFTA02731465](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2012/EFTA02731465.pdf) (Victim Journal)** contains a direct reference to a "president" with identifying details:
   > "Even the old president! They will get you. **He should have been thinking of Chelsea! Gross!** In a plane on a yacht in NY, in DC, at the vineyard, On the island. In palm beach. It doesnt matter."

2. The reference to "Chelsea" is consistent with **Chelsea Clinton**, daughter of **Bill Clinton**, the 42nd President of the United States. The locations listed (plane, yacht, NY, DC, "the vineyard" [Martha's Vineyard], the island [Little St. James], Palm Beach) are all documented locations of Epstein's operations.

3. However, the [EFTA00022133](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00022133.pdf) compilation specifically uses the term **"foreign president"** -- meaning a head of state from a country other than the United States. The journal's "old president" reference to Clinton is separate from the "foreign president" in the accusation compilation.

### Best Identification: Ehud Barak (Former Prime Minister of Israel)

The strongest candidate for the "foreign president" (noting that "president" and "prime minister" may be conflated in informal usage, and the Jane Doe #3 filing separately mentions "a well-known Prime Minister") is **Ehud Barak**, former Prime Minister of Israel:

**Evidence from the databases:**
- [EFTA02422165](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02422165.pdf): Email from Lesley Groff scheduling "Jes-Ehud Barak dinner" for Epstein
- [EFTA02422168](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02422168.pdf): Email about "Tom Barrack-Ehud Barak" connection

- [EFTA01955948](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01955948.pdf): Calendar entry "TBD LUNCH w/Ehud Barak & Joel Klein"
- [EFTA02154241](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA02154241.pdf): "8:30am Breakfast w/Ehud Barak"
- [EFTA02128207](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA02128207.pdf): "w/Ehud Barak & Joel Kl[ein]"
- [EFTA02122068](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA02122068.pdf): "[someone] knows if Ehud Barak is coming"
- [EFTA01903624](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01903624.pdf): Subject line "Ehud Barak"
- [EFTA01802812](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01802812.pdf): Email from "ehbarak" address
- Multiple calendar entries and scheduling emails showing regular, intimate contact
- Nili Priell Barak (Barak's wife) also appears in multiple records ([EFTA02047592](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA02047592.pdf), [EFTA02073960](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA02073960.pdf), [EFTA02088574](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA02088574.pdf), etc.)

Barak served as Prime Minister of Israel (1999-2001) and was documented visiting Epstein's apartment building in New York. The term "foreign president" could easily describe a former PM in casual parlance. The Jane Doe #3 filing ([EFTA00021553](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00021553.pdf)) specifically mentions "a well-known Prime Minister" as a separate category alongside "foreign presidents," suggesting there may be multiple foreign leaders involved.

**Note:** The "foreign president" and the "well-known Prime Minister" in the legal filings may refer to different individuals, or may refer to the same person described inconsistently. Barak is the strongest documented match for either designation.

> **[UPDATE — 2026-02-12]** DS9 calendar documents (EFTA00284xxx-EFTA00287xxx series, Lesley Groff's scheduling records covering 2013-2019) massively expand the documented Barak-Epstein relationship with **15+ new scheduling entries**:
>
> - [EFTA00284747](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00284747.pdf): "3:00pm Appt w/Ehud Barak" (Dec 4, 2013)
> - [EFTA00284799](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00284799.pdf): "7:45pm Casual Dinner w/Terje, Ehud and Nili" (Barak and wife, Sept 2013)

> - [EFTA00284942](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00284942.pdf): "Possibly Ehud Barak to go to JE's island today" (Jan 23, 2014)
> - [EFTA00284949](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00284949.pdf): "DINNER w/Peter Thiel and Ehud Barak" (June 9, 2014)
> - [EFTA00285006](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00285006.pdf): "Fly Ehud Barak from PB, Galaxy Aviation, to Tampa" (Jan 26, 2014) -- Barak on Epstein's aircraft
> - [EFTA00285196](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00285196.pdf): "LUNCH w/Ehud Barak, Tom Barrack and Vital Churkin" (Aug 28, 2016)
> - [EFTA00285740](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00285740.pdf): Two meals in one day -- BREAKFAST + LUNCH w/Ehud Barak (Feb 25, 2019), just 5 months before Epstein's arrest
>
> These entries establish: (1) Barak used Epstein's private aircraft, (2) Barak was invited to Epstein's island, (3) the relationship continued through February 2019, and (4) Nili Priell Barak (wife) traveled with Barak in the Epstein orbit. This elevates the Barak identification from PROBABLE to **STRONG**.

## PART 3: IDENTIFICATION OF THE "FRENCH HOTEL CHAIN OWNER"

### Evidence from [EFTA00022133](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00022133.pdf)

The accusation compilation states Giuffre alleges she was told to have sex with the "owner of 'a French hotel chain.'"

### Best Identification: A Member of the Accor Hotel Family (Possibly Paul Dubrule or Gerard Pelisson) OR an Associate of Jean-Luc Brunel

**Database evidence:**
- [EFTA00007157](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%204/EFTA00007157.pdf) (primary document text database, page 15): Hidden text fragment "Accor in / in the w / about th" -- confirming the Accor hotel chain appears in the investigative files
- [EFTA01719107](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01719107.pdf) (primary document text database, page 15): Identical fragment "Accor in / in the w / about th"
- [EFTA00362478](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00362478.pdf): Larry Summers stayed at "the Sofitel" (an Accor brand) when meeting Epstein
- [EFTA02108305](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA02108305.pdf): "Kafrawi Yuliantono -- SOFITEL Bali Nusa Dua FB" (redacted contact)

The Accor hotel group is a French multinational hospitality company. Its founders, **Paul Dubrule** and **Gerard Pelisson**, were initially considered as possible matches for the description of "French hotel chain owner." However, the databases do not contain direct evidence tying either man to Epstein's abuse network.

> **[CORRECTION — 2026-02-12]** The 14 "Dubrule" hits found in DS9/DS11 all refer to **Sophie Dubrule**, a **Sotheby's Paris** employee who handled Epstein's art consignment -- NOT Paul Dubrule (Accor co-founder, born 1934). Sophie Dubrule arranged the pickup and sale of furniture from Epstein's 22 Avenue Foch apartment in Paris through Sotheby's "Mobilier, Sculptures et Objets d'Art" auction in 2012 ([EFTA00532711](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00532711.pdf), [EFTA02299718](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02299718.pdf)-[EFTA02306530](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02306530.pdf)). Gerard Pelisson's single hit ([EFTA00578074](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00578074.pdf)) is a World Travel & Tourism Council executive committee membership list. The Dubrule/Pelisson lead should be considered **eliminated**.
>
> New Accor hotel **usage** evidence confirms Epstein patronized Accor properties: a Pullman Riga Old Town Hotel credit card authorization ([EFTA00313771](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00313771.pdf)) and multiple Accor online booking confirmations charged to Epstein's Amex ([EFTA00326274](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00326274.pdf)). This confirms hotel usage but does NOT identify the accused individual.

An alternative possibility is that this refers to someone in the broader French hospitality industry connected to Epstein's Paris operations. Epstein maintained a residence in Paris (Avenue Foch), and Jean-Luc Brunel (MC2/Karin Models) was the primary conduit to French connections. The "French hotel chain owner" may have been introduced through Brunel's modeling/entertainment network.

**Confidence Level:** LOW/UNRESOLVED -- The specific identification remains unresolved. The Accor brand appears in travel records and the Dubrule surname in the corpus refers to a Sotheby's employee, not the Accor co-founder.

## PART 4: VICTIM JOURNAL NAMES -- [EFTA02731420](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2012/EFTA02731420.pdf)

### Source Document
[EFTA02731420](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2012/EFTA02731420.pdf) is a multi-page victim journal/scrapbook marked "CONFIDENTIAL FOR ATTORNEY'S EYES ONLY / DO NOT COPY." It contains handwritten entries, poetry, clippings, and references to specific individuals.

### The Name List Entry

> "I am very sorry little one, What are these bets and why do I have to take photos? I am lost. **Mr. Mody. Mr. Robert. Mr. Sant. Mr. Ludwig. Mr. Cecchi. Mr. Mora. Mr. Goodlatte. Mr. Atkins** are not who they say! Run run run!"

### Additional Names from [EFTA02731420](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2012/EFTA02731420.pdf)

| Name in Journal | Context | Best Identification | Confidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Mr. Leonsis** | "flights of horror. Whether its with Jeffrey, Mr. Leonsis, Mr. Case, Mr. Snyder, the Gregorys, Mr. Colgan" | **Ted Leonsis** -- AOL executive, owner of Washington Capitals/Wizards. AOL connection established via victim journal AOL clippings and Vradenburg/Case connections | HIGH |
| **Mr. Case** | Same passage as Leonsis | **Steve Case** -- Co-founder and former CEO of AOL. Fits the AOL cluster of names in the journals | HIGH |
| **Mr. Snyder / Dan Snyder** | "Joe Gibbs is so nice but **Dan Snyder is a pig! A red skin hoggett(sp?)!**" | **Daniel Snyder** -- Former owner of the Washington Redskins (now Commanders). "Red skin hoggett" is clearly a reference to the football team. Joe Gibbs was the Redskins coach. Independently corroborated: Epstein personally referred Snyder to a Palm Beach real estate broker ([EFTA00767027](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00767027.pdf), Dec 2009; [EFTA00764574](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00764574.pdf), Jan 2010). SDNY dismissed a TMZ Snyder arrest rumor as "Insane" ([EFTA00102503](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00102503.pdf)). | CONFIRMED |
| **Mr. Kimsey** | "Mr. Kimsey is deranged, The answer is c. crazy!" | **James V. Kimsey** -- Co-founder of AOL. Fits the AOL/DC tech cluster with Case, Leonsis, Vradenburg | HIGH |
| **Mr. Colgan** | "Why did Mr. Colgan agree to this!" | Unknown -- possibly a local facilitator, attorney, or business associate. No definitive match in databases. | LOW |
| **The Gregorys** | "the Gregorys" (plural, suggesting a couple) | Unknown -- possibly a family involved in Epstein's social circle. No definitive match. | LOW |
| **Leon Black** | "Leon Black" -- poem page; plus "that fat fuck bit me! He threw me on the floor and blood all over Jeffreys carpet" | **Leon Black** -- Apollo Global Management founder. **CONFIRMED** by [EFTA02731662](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2012/EFTA02731662.pdf) (DANY investigation notes) and [EFTA02731721](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2012/EFTA02731721.pdf) (attorney letter describing Black's violent sexual assault including biting, confirmed by investigator Jeanne Christensen of Wigdor Law) | CONFIRMED |
| **Mr. Dana / Dana Chasin** | "For being a Rockefeller that plane Mr. Dana had me on was scary!" [EFTA02731721](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2012/EFTA02731721.pdf) clarifies: "Dana Chasin (Rockefeller's) small prop plane" | **Dana Chasin** -- Connected to the Rockefeller family, flew victim in small prop plane to Epstein's NYC townhouse | CONFIRMED (by attorney letter) |
| **Larry Summers** | "Both he and Larry Summers are fucking disgusting!" [EFTA02731721](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2012/EFTA02731721.pdf): "she had sex with Larry Summers" | **Lawrence Summers** -- Former U.S. Treasury Secretary and Harvard President. Flight logs confirm "Larry Summers" as passenger (entity relationship database entity #251). Multiple emails show scheduling between Summers and Epstein ([EFTA00362463](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00362463.pdf), [EFTA00362478](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00362478.pdf), [EFTA00362481](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00362481.pdf)). | CONFIRMED |
| **George Mitchell** | "even old senators like George Mitchell who you think would be good like a grandpa are bad" | **George Mitchell** -- Former U.S. Senate Majority Leader. Also named in [EFTA00022133](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00022133.pdf) accusation compilation. | CONFIRMED |
| **Andrew** | "Andrew is like his brother in this way!" | **Prince Andrew, Duke of York** -- "his brother" likely refers to Prince Charles (now King Charles III). Multiple references throughout the files. | CONFIRMED |
| **Mr. Glickman** | "my mom lied about Mr. Glickman all the time. She lied about work trips about Michigan and about Clearwater. Now he is dead" | Unknown -- appears to be from victim's personal/family history pre-Epstein, possibly mother's associate | LOW |
| **Mr. Robert** | "Went to a party at this huge house to meet this man named Mr. Robert and his pretty wife Jill. Same exact British lady from Clearwater was there!" ("British lady" = Maxwell) | Unknown -- "Mr. Robert" with wife "Jill." First documented contact with Maxwell's network. | LOW |
| **Joe Gibbs** | "Joe Gibbs is so nice" | **Joe Gibbs** -- Hall of Fame NFL coach of Washington Redskins. Mentioned favorably in contrast to Dan Snyder | NOTED (mentioned positively, not as abuser) |

### Mr. Mody

**[EFTA02731260](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2012/EFTA02731260.pdf)** contains a separate thank-you note addressed to "Mody":
> "Thank you so Mody, for all your coords... and for teaching me how to cycle... Know you. I hope you learn to see... I remember you forever, until I learn to... beauty calling yourself, for you are an absolutely lovely person inside and out."

This appears to be a heartfelt note to someone who taught the victim to cycle and served as a supportive figure. The tone is warm, suggesting "Mody" may have been a caretaker or therapist -- but the [EFTA02731420](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2012/EFTA02731420.pdf) entry says these people "are not who they say!" suggesting betrayal or deception. No definitive identification from the databases.

> **[UPDATE — 2026-02-12]** DS9 contains a complete copy of the victim journal ([EFTA00155037](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00155037.pdf), labeled "EXHIBIT C") with improved OCR text. A search across the full 12-dataset corpus (1,380,937 docs) confirms that all eight ghost names (Mody, Sant, Ludwig, Cecchi, Mora, Goodlatte, Atkins, Colgan) appear **only** in the journal text itself and nowhere else in Epstein's email, financial, calendar, or organizational records. "Cecchi" has zero hits across the entire corpus outside the journal. This strongly supports the victim's own statement that these individuals "are not who they say" -- i.e., the names were aliases used during encounters.

### Mr. Goodlatte

The journal entry asks whether this is Bob Goodlatte, the Virginia congressman. **Bob Goodlatte** served as U.S. Representative for Virginia's 6th district (1993-2019) and was Chairman of the House Judiciary Committee. The victim's journal entries reference Virginia locations (Woodbridge, VA mentioned in [EFTA02731721](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2012/EFTA02731721.pdf)), which falls within the broader Virginia/DC metropolitan area. However, no direct evidence in the databases connects Bob Goodlatte to Epstein. The name is distinctive enough that it warrants further investigation, but identification remains **UNCONFIRMED**.

### Mr. Ludwig

**Daniel K. Ludwig** (1897-1992) was a billionaire shipping magnate who died before the typical timeframe of Epstein's operations. If the journal dates to the late 1990s-early 2000s, Ludwig would already have been deceased. This may refer to a different person named Ludwig -- possibly a professional using the name in connection with the victim's exploitation. No definitive match in the databases. **UNRESOLVED**.

## PART 5: VICTIM JOURNAL NAMES -- [EFTA02731465](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2012/EFTA02731465.pdf)

### Source Document
[EFTA02731465](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2012/EFTA02731465.pdf) is a second victim journal also marked "CONFIDENTIAL FOR ATTORNEY'S EYES ONLY / DO NOT COPY." It contains more visceral and detailed accounts of abuse.

### Names and Identifications

| Name in Journal | Context | Best Identification | Confidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Allen "Douschewitz"** | "Disgusting pigs like Allen Douschewitz and Mr. Caruthers and even Mr. Islam will hurt you especially if Ghislaine is busy or not with you!" | **Alan Dershowitz** -- Harvard Law professor. Phonetic misspelling is clearly intentional/derogatory. Named in [EFTA00022133](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00022133.pdf) and [EFTA00021553](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00021553.pdf). | CONFIRMED |
| **Mr. Caruthers** | Same passage, named alongside Dershowitz and "Mr. Islam" as someone who "will hurt you" | Unknown -- distinctive spelling. No match in redaction databases. Possibly a pseudonym or lesser-known associate. | UNRESOLVED |
| **Mr. Islam** | Same passage. Named as dangerous: "even Mr. Islam will hurt you" | Unknown -- could be a surname or a reference to someone's religious background. No match in databases. | UNRESOLVED |
| **Mr. Leonsis** | "Why would they all allow Mr. Leonsis wait this long? Why would he bring a friend and make a video?" | **Ted Leonsis** -- AOL executive, Washington sports team owner. The reference to "bring a friend and make a video" is deeply disturbing and suggests documented abuse. | HIGH |
| **Mr. Rails** | "Mr. Rails and Mr. Ein [clipping: blood on their hands]" | DS9 journal copy ([EFTA00155037](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00155037.pdf), page 14) confirms full name as "Mr. Rails" -- not "Raines" or similar. No definitive match in the corpus. | UNRESOLVED |
| **Mr. Ein** | Same passage -- "Mr. Ein [clipping: blood on their hands]" | Unknown -- could be a partial name. Possibly related to someone from Epstein's financial network. | UNRESOLVED |
| **Mr. Jacobson** | "but so does Jeffrey and Mr. Jacobson. Mr. Conway Mr. vradenberg and Bill s" | Unknown -- Jacobson is a common surname. The context lists him among those who "dont care if this happens" (referring to a painful medical procedure, likely an abortion). Could be a doctor or financial associate. | UNRESOLVED |
| **Mr. Conway** | Same passage | Unknown -- no definitive match. | UNRESOLVED |
| **Mr. vradenberg** | "Mr. vradenberg and Bill s" | **George Vradenburg III** -- Senior Vice President of AOL. This matches the previously identified connection. Vradenburg was a prominent DC figure connected to the AOL cluster (Case, Leonsis, Kimsey). | HIGH |
| **Bill s** | "Mr. vradenberg and Bill s" (partially cut off) | Likely **Bill S[omeone]** -- could be Bill Staley, Bill Sorenson, or another "Bill S." The context groups him with Vradenburg among those described by the victim in this passage. Possibly a reference to a truncated "Bill S[ummers]" but that seems unlikely given Larry Summers is the known name. | UNRESOLVED |
| **Mr. Sauerkraut krauss** | "Mr. Sauerkraut krauss and martin minsky are gross" | **Lawrence Krauss** -- Theoretical physicist, Foundation Professor at ASU. "Sauerkraut" is a derogatory nickname (German/food reference). Krauss has extensive documented ties to Epstein: emails about legal strategy ([EFTA02518850](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02518850.pdf), [EFTA02518897](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02518897.pdf)), travel coordination ([EFTA02589076](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02589076.pdf)), being named as trustee ([EFTA02570951](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02570951.pdf), [EFTA02570988](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02570988.pdf)), and was publicly accused of sexual harassment at ASU. | HIGH |
| **martin minsky** | Same passage | **Marvin Minsky** -- Late MIT computer scientist/AI pioneer. Named in [EFTA00022133](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00022133.pdf) accusation compilation. The misspelling of the first name ("martin" vs. "Marvin") is consistent with a young victim's recollection. | CONFIRMED |
| **Mr. Novak** | "I felt sort of sorry for Mr. Novak. He was as uncomfortable as me." | Unknown -- the victim expresses sympathy, suggesting Novak was reluctant or coerced. No definitive match in databases. | UNRESOLVED |
| **Mr. staley** | "The disgusting Mr. staley if anyone ever calls me tinkerbell again I will lose my mind. He left bloody marks on my arms from his belt and thought he had the right to call me that when he has ears as big as a dumbo." | **Jes Staley** -- Former CEO of Barclays, former JPMorgan executive. **CONFIRMED** by: [EFTA02731082](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2012/EFTA02731082.pdf) (FBI memo: "Epstein instructed [victim] to provide a massage to Jes Staley"); [EFTA00029358](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00029358.pdf) ("one of the non/minor Epstein victims alleges that Jes Staley (reads in memo as 'Jess Daily') raped her during a massage"); [EFTA02731737](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2012/EFTA02731737.pdf) ("They believe she was also abused by Staley"); [EFTA00029429](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00029429.pdf)-[EFTA00029437](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00029437.pdf) (Epstein-Staley emails referencing "Snow White," "Beauty and the Beast," and "Is she free tonight?"); entity relationship database entity #4 (victim allegation of forced sexual assault during massage). The "tinkerbell" nickname and belt marks describe sadistic physical abuse. | CONFIRMED |
| **Ms. Vicki** | "I will never be able to forgive myself for not being able to tell you what Ms. Vicki does and what really happens in FL and CA." | Unknown female facilitator/recruiter operating in **Florida and California**. No definitive identification in databases. The name suggests a woman who served as a local facilitator/madam in multiple states, separate from Maxwell's role. | UNRESOLVED |
| **Weinstein** | "I hope you dont ever meet fat pig Weinstein or the rest" | **Harvey Weinstein** -- Film producer later convicted of rape and sexual assault. Mentioned as someone the victim warns about. | HIGH |
| **The "old president"** | "Even the old president! They will get you. He should have been thinking of Chelsea!" | **Bill Clinton** -- 42nd President of the United States. The "Chelsea" reference is unmistakable. Locations listed (plane, yacht, NY, DC, vineyard, island, Palm Beach) match Epstein's documented operations. Clinton's flights on Epstein's plane are documented in flight logs. | HIGH |

### The AOL Cluster

A striking pattern emerges from the journals: multiple senior AOL executives and associates are named together:
- **Steve Case** (AOL co-founder/CEO)
- **Jim Kimsey** (AOL co-founder)
- **Ted Leonsis** (AOL executive, Capitals/Wizards owner)
- **George Vradenburg III** (AOL SVP)

Additionally, the journals contain clippings about AOL with the comment:
> "That company does not protect kids! They use it to find us! And they are everywhere! I cannot escape!"

This suggests the victim believed AOL's technology was used in recruitment/control operations, and that multiple AOL executives were participants in or aware of Epstein's network.

### The Pregnancy/Forced Abortion Evidence

[EFTA02731465](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2012/EFTA02731465.pdf) contains disturbing references to forced pregnancy and abortion:
> "I am now over 20 weeks with a baby we are certain is his and I had to go to the Bahamas like this! And for some reason no plan has been made because he does not want a procedure and she does and I am certain this is time critical but they won't stop fighting!"

[EFTA02731420](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2012/EFTA02731420.pdf) contains a sonogram reference:
> "I heard the heart beat even when she put her hands over my ears. Arent pictures enough for them? ... Should I deeply miss them? Have these all been.... [MURDERS]? Does this make me a [KILLER]?"

The "procedure" references, combined with "blood all over the sheets" and the victim becoming ill with fever, describe forced abortions. The names listed around these entries (Jacobson, Conway, Vradenberg, "Bill s") are described as people who "dont care if this happens."

## PART 6: CORROBORATING EVIDENCE -- THE ATTORNEY LETTER ([EFTA02731721](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2012/EFTA02731721.pdf))

A critical corroborating document is [EFTA02731721](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2012/EFTA02731721.pdf), an email from attorney **Jeanne M. Christensen of Wigdor Law** (dated March 13, 2024) discussing the victim's case:

Key revelations:
1. The victim's **biological mother** "took all of her directions from" someone and had "forced [the victim] to perform sexual acts with adult men since she was very young"
2. "Her younger sister also. Even worse, the paternal grandfather... was in on it."
3. The mother "brought [the victim] (age 15) and her sister (then 12) down to Florida where they each met Maxwell in a hotel room, separately"
4. **Leon Black**: "When [the victim] had a meltdown after Leon used large adult sex toys in her anus and she was bleeding and wanted to see a doctor - the reaction from Epstein, Maxwell and her parents was one of anger with her."
5. **Dana Chasin**: "[The mother] knew Dana Chasin and that is how [the victim] was flown to NYC the first time (where she had sex with Larry Summers)"
6. **Larry Summers**: Confirmed as a participant in sexual abuse
7. The victim "knew so many of the men's actual last names" because her mother "spoke matter of factly... about what she was expected to do, when and with whom"

## PART 8: KEY FINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS

### Critical Findings

1. **The "foreign president"** in [EFTA00022133](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00022133.pdf) most likely refers to **Ehud Barak**, based on extensive documented contact between Barak and Epstein in the email and calendar records. DS9 calendar documents provide 15+ scheduling entries spanning 2013-2019, including Epstein flying Barak on his private aircraft, a documented island invitation, and meetings continuing through February 2019 (five months before arrest). Barak is the only foreign head of state/government with deep, personal, repeated interaction documented in the files.

2. **The "French hotel chain" owner** remains unidentified. The word "Accor" appears in redacted text within police investigative files ([EFTA00007157](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%204/EFTA00007157.pdf), page 15), and Accor hotel booking confirmations appear in Epstein's credit card records. The "Dubrule" surname in DS9/DS11 was definitively identified as Sophie Dubrule of Sotheby's Paris (not Paul Dubrule, Accor co-founder), eliminating the most promising lead. No specific individual from the Accor ownership/management is named in connection with abuse.

3. **The AOL cluster** (Case, Kimsey, Leonsis, Vradenburg) represents a previously underappreciated network of tech executives connected to Epstein's operations. The victim's journal entries about AOL being used "to find us" warrant further investigation into whether AOL's technology or resources were exploited for recruitment purposes.

4. **Jes Staley** is described in extreme physical abuse terms ("bloody marks on my arms from his belt") in the victim journal, corroborated by FBI investigative memos, prosecutor communications, and Epstein-Staley emails using coded Disney character references.

5. **Leon Black** is described as violently assaulting the victim (biting, throwing on floor, use of sex toys causing bleeding), corroborated by DANY (Manhattan DA) investigation notes and the Wigdor Law attorney letter.

6. **Dana Chasin** is identified as a Rockefeller-connected individual who provided air transportation for the victim to Epstein's NYC residence, where abuse by Larry Summers occurred.

7. **Ms. Vicki** remains unidentified but operated as a facilitator in both Florida and California, suggesting a geographically mobile recruiter separate from Maxwell's operation.

8. **The pregnancy/forced abortion evidence** in the journals, combined with the sonogram image referenced in [EFTA02731420](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2012/EFTA02731420.pdf), represents potential evidence of additional crimes beyond sexual trafficking.

### Recommended Further Investigation

- Subpoena Accor hotel group records for any business relationship with Epstein, Brunel, or Maxwell
- Investigate "Mr. Robert" with wife "Jill" as the potential entry point for victim into the network via Maxwell
- Identify "Ms. Vicki" through Florida and California massage/modeling business records
- Cross-reference "Mr. Caruthers," "Mr. Islam," and "Mr. Rails" against Epstein's contact lists and flight manifests
- Investigate the AOL technology angle referenced in the journals
- Determine if Bob Goodlatte (Virginia congressman) had any documented contact with Epstein or his associates
