# DEEP DIVE: Kathryn "Kathy" Ruemmler and Jeffrey Epstein
## Former Obama White House Counsel / Goldman Sachs General Counsel

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Kathryn Ruemmler served as White House Counsel to President Barack Obama from June 2011 to May 2014. After leaving the White House, she joined Latham & Watkins as a partner and was later appointed Goldman Sachs General Counsel in 2020. The FBI files reveal a sustained, intimate personal relationship between Ruemmler and Jeffrey Epstein spanning at minimum from **July 2014 through at least January 2019** -- beginning approximately two months after she left the White House and continuing for over four years well after Epstein's 2008 sex offense conviction was public knowledge. One additional document dates to **May 2019**, just two months before Epstein's final arrest. An Epstein iMessage from January 9, 2019 ([EFTA00509013](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00509013.pdf)) confirms he planned "kathy for breakfast tomorrow," placing the relationship as active after the Miami Herald's November 2018 "Perversion of Justice" series.

The documents total **over 100 unique records** across the FBI databases (DS9 and DS11 together contain at minimum 80+ unique EFTA documents referencing Ruemmler by name, plus trust documents, financial records, gift documentation, and calendar entries), revealing a relationship that was simultaneously personal, quasi-legal/advisory, fiduciary, and deeply intertwined with Epstein's social and political networks. The most significant finding from the full corpus revisit is that **Ruemmler was a named Trustee on the Jeffrey E. Epstein 2018 Trust** ([EFTA00099449](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00099449.pdf)), alongside Darren K. Indyke and Richard D. Kahn -- a formal fiduciary relationship, not merely a social connection. The correspondence shows Epstein was advising Ruemmler on a major job offer, that Ruemmler was providing Epstein with political intelligence, that Epstein offered her use of his Paris apartment and staff, and that Epstein explicitly recognized the risk her association with him posed to her reputation as a "role model for women" and to the Obama and Clinton political legacies.

## DOCUMENT-BY-DOCUMENT ANALYSIS

### Document 1: [EFTA02589109](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02589109.pdf) -- September 5, 2014 (Earliest Direct Email)
**From:** Jeffrey Epstein (jeevacation@gmail.com)
**To:** Kathy Ruemmler
**Content:** "do you have to speak today?"

**Analysis:** A brief, casual check-in suggesting an ongoing dialogue. Ruemmler had left the White House approximately four months earlier (May 2014). The brevity and informality suggest an already-established rapport. The question implies awareness of her schedule and professional commitments.

### Document 2: [EFTA00362480](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00362480.pdf) -- September 15, 2014 (Lesley Groff Scheduling)
**From:** Lesley Groff (Epstein's executive assistant)
**To:** Jeffrey Epstein
**Subject:** Tim Zagat
**Content:**
> "Please call Tim Zagat at home...Tim will be back in NY on 24th...he is hoping that will be good for you to have dinner."
>
> "Wed. Sept. 24, 2014 NY"
> "Reminder: Win apt LIP Sept. 24-Oct. 7"
> "Reminder: Rosh Hashanah begins at sundown"
> "**TBD Jagland (Kathy Ruemmler is in NY and would love to join)**"

**Analysis:** This is an internal scheduling document showing Ruemmler was being considered as a guest at a dinner with **Thorbjorn Jagland**, who was at that time the **Chairman of the Norwegian Nobel Committee** (2009-2015) and Secretary General of the Council of Europe. The notation shows Ruemmler actively wanted to attend ("would love to join"), and that Epstein was the intermediary enabling access to the Nobel Committee chair. The same scheduling note references Epstein's New York apartment ("Win apt") and a Tim Zagat dinner.

**Cross-reference: [EFTA00362483](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00362483.pdf)** -- A companion scheduling document from the same day lists Epstein's visitors for the week:
> "People To See: Jagland, Terje, Thiel, Simon, **Kathy**, Cas, Kasak, India, Summers, Boris, Barbro"
> Larry Summers confirmed for Monday Sept 22nd at 3pm.

Ruemmler ("Kathy") was listed alongside **Larry Summers** (former Treasury Secretary), **Peter Thiel**, and Jagland as people Epstein planned to see that week. This places her squarely within Epstein's high-level political and financial network.

### Document 3: [EFTA02517295](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02517295.pdf) -- September 30, 2014 (The "First Choice" Exchange)
**Multi-page email thread between Epstein and Ruemmler**

**Key exchange (earliest in thread):**
> **Epstein:** "fun?"
> **Ruemmler:** "Yes. We are having a good meeting."
>
> **Epstein:** "im told you are definitely his first choice but not sure you can be convinced. money etc"
> **Ruemmler:** "Told by whom?"
>
> **Epstein:** "ves said he was very happy"
> **Ruemmler:** "Good. Will call when I get to the train station."
>
> **Later that day:**
> **Ruemmler:** "Ok. If I don't talk to you today, I'll catch up with you tomorrow. Ruth Marcus at wapo wrote an unhelpful piece."
> **Epstein:** "Ok"

**Analysis - "Definitely His First Choice":**
This is one of the most significant exchanges. Epstein told Ruemmler she was "definitely his first choice" for some position, noting concern about whether she could "be convinced" given "money etc." The conversation shows:

1. Epstein had received information from an unnamed source about a hiring or appointment decision involving Ruemmler
2. Someone ("ves") had told Epstein they were "very happy" about Ruemmler
3. Ruemmler was interested enough to ask "told by whom?" -- seeking Epstein's information source
4. The **Ruth Marcus** reference is to Ruth Marcus, a Washington Post columnist. Ruemmler called her piece "unhelpful," suggesting Marcus had written something critical, possibly about Ruemmler or about the position in question

**Timing context:** September 2014 was approximately four months after Ruemmler left the White House. DS9 reveals that on September 26-27, 2014 -- just four days before this "first choice" exchange -- Epstein forwarded a New York Times article about Ruemmler as a candidate for **U.S. Attorney General** to at least four contacts: Jes Staley ([EFTA00997717](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00997717.pdf)), Ariane de Rothschild ([EFTA00997716](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00997716.pdf)), Peter Thiel ([EFTA00997718](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00997718.pdf)), and Jabor Yousuf ([EFTA00997715](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00997715.pdf)). Staley responded: "I saw that" ([EFTA00665341](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00665341.pdf)). The timing strongly suggests the "first choice" conversation concerned the AG nomination, not a private sector position. "Money etc." would refer to the pay cut from private practice. Epstein's active circulation of the AG article to his network demonstrates his interest in Ruemmler's potential appointment.

### Document 4: [EFTA02513986](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02513986.pdf) -- January 12, 2015 (The "Benjamin" Discussion)
**From:** Jeffrey Epstein
**To:** Kathy Ruemmler
**Subject:** Re:

> **Ruemmler (prior email):** "had assumed you were exaggerating a bit about Benjamin. Wrong assumption."
>
> **Epstein:** "i have no first hand knowledge ive never met, his father 30 years ago knew a problem was in the future"

**Analysis:**
Ruemmler and Epstein were discussing **Benjamin de Rothschild** -- this is now confirmed by cross-referencing with the Rothschild investigation file. In March 2014 emails ([EFTA02395020](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02395020.pdf)), Ariane told Epstein: "CAN't Call as B[enjamin] majorly f***ed up at the House. The girls are afraid." Epstein's response -- "He is in a deeply sliding curve and nothing seems to stop him" -- combined with the reference to Benjamin's father ("his father 30 years ago knew a problem was in the future"), points to Edmond Adolphe de Rothschild (1926-1997), confirming Epstein's relationship with the Rothschild family dated back to approximately 1985. The joint calendar entry "Appt w/Kathy & Ariane" ([EFTA02075023](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA02075023.pdf)) confirms Ruemmler and Ariane de Rothschild met jointly with Epstein -- likely the meeting where Ruemmler observed Benjamin's behavior firsthand. Ruemmler at Latham & Watkins subsequently represented Edmond de Rothschild (Suisse) SA in its DOJ Non-Prosecution Agreement ([EFTA00590334](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00590334.pdf)), in which the bank paid $45,245,000 -- confirming Epstein connected Ruemmler with the Rothschild family as a client.

### Document 5: [EFTA02513974](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02513974.pdf) -- January 13, 2015 (La Reserve / Geneva)
**From:** Jeffrey Epstein
**To:** Kathy Ruemmler
**Content:**
> "as long as you get some real sleep tomrw night. massage at la reserve is pretty good"
>
> **Prior email from Epstein:** "if you stay at a hotel when you return to genve to work try la reserve, not in town, nice to wake up"

**Analysis:**
Epstein was recommending **La Reserve**, a luxury hotel in Geneva, Switzerland, to Ruemmler, who was apparently traveling to Geneva for work. He specifically recommended the hotel's massage. The instruction to "get some real sleep" suggests awareness of her travel schedule and physical well-being -- a level of personal intimacy consistent with close friendship.

**Geneva context:** In January 2015, Ruemmler was likely traveling to Geneva in connection with her legal work at Latham & Watkins, which has major international corporate clients. The fact that Epstein was her go-to advisor for Geneva hotel recommendations underscores the depth of the personal relationship.

### Document 6: [EFTA02513945](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02513945.pdf) -- January 14, 2015 (Paris Apartment & Staff)
**From:** Jeffrey Epstein
**To:** HBB (likely staff/assistant), CC Kathy Ruemmler
**Content:**
> "HBB kathy is going to be in paris, please have valdson at her disposal. he can show her the apt. drive her, give her his egg dish thanks"

**Analysis:**
This is an extraordinary document. Epstein directed his staff to place his **Paris apartment** and personal driver/staffer "Valdson" at Ruemmler's disposal during her visit to Paris. Valdson was instructed to:
- Show her the apartment
- Drive her around Paris
- Cook for her ("give her his egg dish")

This represents a significant material benefit -- free luxury accommodation in Paris, a personal driver, and personal chef service. The casual tone ("his egg dish") suggests this was not the first such arrangement.

"Valdson" appears in multiple other documents ([EFTA00304269](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00304269.pdf), [EFTA00304274](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00304274.pdf), [EFTA00304278](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00304278.pdf), [EFTA00304282](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00304282.pdf), [EFTA02236057](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02236057.pdf), [EFTA02271384](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02271384.pdf), [EFTA02271388](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02271388.pdf), [EFTA02299111](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02299111.pdf), [EFTA02317834](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02317834.pdf), [EFTA02319047](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02319047.pdf), [EFTA02388580](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02388580.pdf), [EFTA02570959](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02570959.pdf), [EFTA02575354](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02575354.pdf)) as a regular member of Epstein's Paris household staff.

### Document 7: [EFTA02490379](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02490379.pdf) -- August 22, 2015
**From:** Jeffrey Epstein
**To:** Kathy Ruemmler
**Content:** "back in wash? or new yokr?"

**Analysis:** Brief check-in about her location. The informality and the 4:13 AM send time suggest a casual, ongoing back-and-forth consistent with a close personal relationship.

---

### Document 8: [EFTA02484285](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02484285.pdf) -- October 12, 2015 (THE KEY DOCUMENT)
**From:** Jeffrey Epstein
**To:** Kathy Ruemmler
**Content:**
> "seen as the good friend that you are. might bring unhelpful criticism of the important role model that you have become for women... defense counsel might create clinton obama unnecessary implication. either way i appreciate the help but we should be extra thoughtful. as surrounded by publicity seeking lawyers etc"

**CRITICAL ANALYSIS -- "Clinton Obama Unnecessary Implication":**

Epstein was writing to Ruemmler about her providing him some form of "help" -- likely legal advice, a character reference, or assistance with his legal defense. He articulated four distinct risks:

1. **"seen as the good friend that you are"** -- Epstein acknowledged the relationship was visible and characterized it as genuine friendship
2. **"might bring unhelpful criticism of the important role model that you have become for women"** -- Epstein recognized that Ruemmler, as the first female White House Counsel to serve a full term, had symbolic importance. Association with a convicted sex offender could destroy that.
3. **"defense counsel might create clinton obama unnecessary implication"** -- This is the most significant line. Epstein warned that opposing defense counsel (in some legal proceeding) could use Ruemmler's involvement to draw connections to both **Bill Clinton** and **Barack Obama**. This suggests:
   - Ruemmler was considering some form of involvement in Epstein's legal matters
   - Epstein understood that any such involvement would implicate her former principals (Clinton via Epstein's known flights/association; Obama via Ruemmler's role as his White House Counsel)
   - The phrase "unnecessary implication" suggests Epstein wanted to protect Clinton and Obama from scrutiny, not just Ruemmler
4. **"surrounded by publicity seeking lawyers etc"** -- Epstein characterized opposing counsel (likely plaintiff attorneys in civil litigation by Epstein's victims) as "publicity seeking"

**Legal Context:** In October 2015, Epstein was facing ongoing civil litigation from victims. The Virginia Giuffre (Roberts) case against Ghislaine Maxwell was active, and multiple other civil suits were pending or being prepared. Ruemmler, with her DOJ and White House background, would have been an extraordinarily valuable legal advisor or character witness for Epstein -- but Epstein himself recognized the political danger.

**The Clinton-Obama Connection:** The document indicates that Epstein was aware his network connections to the Clinton and Obama administrations could be exploited in legal proceedings. By warning Ruemmler that "defense counsel might create clinton obama unnecessary implication," he appeared to be:
- Acknowledging that his ties to Clinton were a known vulnerability
- Recognizing that Ruemmler's involvement would create a direct line from Epstein to the Obama White House
- Seeking to avoid what he characterized as an "unnecessary" — i.e., unwarranted — implication for Clinton and Obama

### Document 9: [EFTA02474948](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02474948.pdf) -- January 20, 2016 ("Re: PW, I Have Another Idea")
**From:** Kathy Ruemmler (initiating)
**To:** Jeffrey Epstein
**Content:**
> **Ruemmler:** "Re: PW, I have another idea."
> **Epstein:** "Number?"

**Analysis:**
Ruemmler was proposing an "idea" related to "PW" -- likely a person (initials P.W.) or a project. Epstein's response asking for her phone number suggests he wanted to discuss this idea verbally rather than in writing. The fact that Ruemmler initiated this exchange ("I have another idea") shows her as an active participant in whatever "PW" referred to, not merely a passive recipient of Epstein's outreach.

### Document 10: [EFTA02470950](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02470950.pdf) -- February 19, 2016 (Phone Number Exchange / "Air Con Photo")
**From:** Jeffrey Epstein
**To:** Kathy Ruemmler
**Multi-part exchange:**
> **Epstein:** "awake?"
> **Epstein (later):** "Don't forget to tell me tomorrow. Just got home from work -- thought I was done working 15-hour days."
> **Epstein:** "funny story when you get a moment"
> **Epstein:** "air con photo"
> **Ruemmler:** "Yes. 301-320-1604" (her phone number)

**Analysis:**
Ruemmler shared her personal cell phone number (301 area code = Maryland/Washington DC area). The exchange reveals a pattern of late-night/early morning communication. Epstein's "awake?" is a check-in characteristic of a close personal relationship. The "air con photo" reference and the "funny story" suggest they shared casual personal content. Epstein's mention of "working 15-hour days" is notable given his purported profession.

### Document 11: [EFTA02395018](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02395018.pdf) -- July 3, 2016 (Ken Lunch at Epstein's House)
**From:** Kathy Ruemmler
**To:** Jeffrey Epstein
**Content:**
> **Epstein:** "If you like you can invite Ken to lunch at my house wed."
> **Ruemmler:** "I think I have to at least meet him"

**Analysis:**
Epstein offered to host a lunch at his home where Ruemmler could meet someone named "Ken." Ruemmler's response ("I think I have to at least meet him") suggests this was a professional introduction that Epstein was facilitating. The willingness to attend lunch at Epstein's residence (likely the East 71st Street Manhattan townhouse) in July 2016 -- when Epstein's sex crime conviction was eight years old and widely reported -- demonstrates the depth of the relationship.

### Document 12: [EFTA02664900](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02664900.pdf) -- December 25, 2016 (Christmas Day)
**From:** Jeffrey Epstein
**To:** Kathy Ruemmler
**Content:**
> **Ruemmler:** "Back home in NY."
> **Epstein:** "welcome back, what are your plans?"

**Analysis:** A Christmas Day exchange. Ruemmler informed Epstein she was back in New York, and he immediately asked about her plans. The holiday timing underscores the personal nature of the relationship.

### Document 13: [EFTA02575359](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02575359.pdf) -- October 29, 2017 (Sealed Indictment / Manafort)
**From:** Jeffrey Epstein
**To:** Kathy Ruemmler
**Content:**
> "news?? why would they file a sealed indictment? if it is true"

**CRITICAL ANALYSIS:**
**Date significance:** October 29, 2017 was the exact date that **CNN reported** the first charges had been filed in Special Counsel Robert Mueller's investigation. The sealed indictment against **Paul Manafort** and **Rick Gates** was returned on October 27, 2017, and reported on October 28-29. Manafort was arrested on October 30.

Epstein turned to Ruemmler -- the former White House Counsel, former senior DOJ official (she led the Enron prosecution), and a premier white-collar defense attorney -- for her perspective on this legal development. His questions:
1. "news??" -- seeking her perspective
2. "why would they file a sealed indictment?" -- asking for her legal expertise on Mueller's strategy
3. "if it is true" -- seeking her assessment of the report's credibility

**Why this matters:** Epstein reached out to Ruemmler for her legal expertise on a major federal proceeding. Her former White House Counsel and DOJ prosecutor background made her a natural person to consult on such developments. The exchange is consistent with the broader pattern of Epstein seeking Ruemmler's legal perspective and Ruemmler engaging with his questions.

### Document 14: [EFTA02570921](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02570921.pdf) -- November 4, 2017 ("Your Nigerian")
**From:** Jeffrey Epstein
**To:** Kathy Ruemmler
**Full exchange:**
> **Epstein:** "your nigerian is a lefty. predisposed to empower women. minorities etc... its your to lose"
> **Ruemmler:** "Jeez - no pressure!"
> **Epstein:** "youre used to it... unless its another woman. he could never explain turning you down. :)"

**CRITICAL ANALYSIS -- "Your Nigerian":**

Epstein was coaching Ruemmler about someone he described as "your nigerian" who was:
- Politically left-leaning ("a lefty")
- Inclined to "empower women, minorities"
- In a position to select or appoint Ruemmler ("its your to lose")
- Male ("he could never explain turning you down")

**Identification:** The phrase "your Nigerian" combined with the context of a decision-maker who could not "explain turning you down" and was "predisposed to empower women" strongly suggests **Adebayo Ogunlesi**, the Nigerian-American chairman of Global Infrastructure Partners who sits on the Goldman Sachs Board of Directors. This identification is now near-certain: DS11 reveals Epstein was actively discussing Ogunlesi by name with David Stern (former NBA Commissioner) on **October 31, 2017** ([EFTA02572098](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02572098.pdf)) -- just four days before the "your Nigerian is a lefty" email to Ruemmler on November 4, 2017. Stern responded simply "No" ([EFTA02572553](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02572553.pdf)), suggesting Epstein had asked whether Stern knew Ogunlesi.

Given the timing (November 2017) and Ruemmler's later appointment as **Goldman Sachs General Counsel** (announced in 2020), this exchange appears to relate to an early stage of that hiring process or a related high-level corporate position.

Epstein's coaching language reveals:
- He had intelligence about this decision-maker's preferences and politics
- He was actively helping Ruemmler strategize for the role
- He believed her gender was an advantage ("he could never explain turning you down")
- The relationship was so close he could pressure her about career decisions

### Document 15: [EFTA02570967](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02570967.pdf) -- November 2017 (St. James Park Photo)
**From:** Kathy Ruemmler
**To:** Jeffrey Epstein
**Subject:** St James Park
**Attachments:** IMG_2220.JPG; Untitled attachment 00134.txt

**Analysis:**
Ruemmler sent Epstein a photo from **St. James's Park** in London. This is a purely personal communication -- sharing a vacation or travel photo. The direction of this exchange (Ruemmler to Epstein) shows she was actively maintaining the relationship, not just responding to his outreach.

---

### Document 16: [EFTA02560625](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02560625.pdf) -- November 28, 2017 (Russia Doping Article)
**From:** Jeffrey Epstein
**To:** Kathy Ruemmler
**Content:** A shared NYT link about Russia doping scandal (Olympics).

**Analysis:** Epstein shared a New York Times article about Russian Olympic doping with Ruemmler. This is consistent with a pattern of sharing news articles and staying in regular communication.

---

### Document 17: [EFTA02532942](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02532942.pdf) -- January 28, 2018 (Last Known Direct Email)
**From:** Jeffrey Epstein
**To:** Kathy Ruemmler
**Content:** "awake? chat?"

**Analysis:** The final known email in the direct correspondence -- again, a late-night/early morning "awake?" check-in, mirroring the February 2016 exchange. This format suggests a regular pattern: Epstein checking if Ruemmler was available for a phone call, typically at unusual hours.

---

### Document 18: [EFTA02285667](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02285667.pdf) -- May 21, 2019 (Latest Known Communication)
**From:** Kathy Ruemmler (OCR reads "Kathy Ruemmiler" -- OCR error)
**Subject:** Re: Jeffrey Epstein
**Partial content:** "NY and I know you and he are"

**CRITICAL ANALYSIS:**
This email is dated **May 21, 2019** -- less than two months before Epstein's arrest on July 6, 2019. The subject line "Re: Jeffrey Epstein" indicates Ruemmler was communicating with an unidentified recipient about Epstein. The partial text "NY and I know you and he are" suggests she was discussing Epstein's New York presence and someone else's relationship with him.

The "To:" field is redacted. This could be communication with another person about Epstein, or it could be a forwarded chain. Either way, it demonstrates that Ruemmler's connection to Epstein was active as late as May 2019.

### Document 19: [EFTA02066243](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA02066243.pdf) -- Richard Kahn / Ruemmler Connection
**Redaction database data:**
- Page 0: "Richard Kahn" / "Subject: Re: Kathy Ruemmler"
- Page 1: "Subject: Re: Jeffrey Epstein"

**Analysis:**
**Richard Kahn** was Epstein's longtime personal accountant who ran HBRK Associates from 575 Lexington Avenue, New York. He managed Epstein's financial accounts, trusts, and was listed alongside **Darren Indyke** (Epstein's attorney) as a key financial gatekeeper.

This document shows an email where Richard Kahn's message has the subject "Re: Kathy Ruemmler" and on the next page, the subject "Re: Jeffrey Epstein." This indicates internal Epstein organization communications about Ruemmler -- possibly regarding logistics, financial arrangements, or coordination of Epstein's interactions with her.

The fact that Epstein's accountant was involved in correspondence mentioning Ruemmler by name suggests either:
- Financial arrangements were being made on her behalf (consistent with the Paris apartment/staff access)
- Her visits or interactions required logistical coordination through Epstein's team
- She was a sufficiently important contact to warrant internal discussion

Redaction reveals: "de Rothschild-2" and "Ruemmler" appearing together. This places Ruemmler in the same document as a Rothschild family reference, consistent with overlapping social/financial networks. Epstein maintained close ties to the **Rothschild** banking family.

### [EFTA02092624](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA02092624.pdf) -- Bella Klein to Ruemmler
Redaction reveals: "Bella Klein" / "To: Kath Ruemmler." **Bella Klein** was Epstein's personal assistant/household staff member who handled scheduling and logistics. A direct communication from Klein to Ruemmler suggests coordination of visits, travel, or other logistical arrangements directly between Epstein's household and Ruemmler.

### [EFTA02195931](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA02195931.pdf) -- CC'd Communication
Redaction reveals: "Cc: Kathy Ruemmler" -- she was CC'd on some internal or group communication.

## ANALYTICAL FINDINGS

### 1. NATURE OF THE RELATIONSHIP

The relationship was **multifaceted**, combining elements of:

**Personal friendship:**
- "awake? chat?" late-night check-ins (Feb 2016, Jan 2018)
- Sharing vacation photos (St. James Park, London)
- Christmas Day communication
- Hotel and massage recommendations
- Sharing news articles

**Material benefits flowing from Epstein to Ruemmler:**
- Use of Epstein's Paris apartment
- Personal driver (Valdson) placed "at her disposal"
- Personal chef services
- Social introductions (Jagland/Nobel Committee, "Ken")

**Quasi-legal/advisory:**
- Discussion of sealed indictments (Mueller/Manafort)
- "Defense counsel might create clinton obama unnecessary implication"
- "PW, I have another idea"
- Epstein acknowledging her "help" while warning of risks

**Career mentoring/intelligence:**
- "Definitely his first choice but not sure you can be convinced"
- "Your nigerian is a lefty... its your to lose"
- Active coaching on job prospects

### 2. "CLINTON OBAMA UNNECESSARY IMPLICATION" -- Context

The October 12, 2015 email ([EFTA02484285](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02484285.pdf)) was written in the context of Epstein's ongoing civil litigation from victims. Ruemmler had apparently offered or was considering offering some form of assistance to Epstein's legal defense. Epstein warned her off because:

- **Clinton connection:** Bill Clinton had flown on Epstein's plane multiple times and visited Epstein's properties. Any involvement by a Clinton-adjacent figure (Ruemmler worked at the DOJ during the Clinton administration before joining the Obama White House) would renew scrutiny.
- **Obama connection:** Ruemmler served as Obama's White House Counsel. Her involvement with Epstein's defense would create an inescapable link from Epstein to the sitting Democratic administration (Obama was still president in October 2015).
- **"Defense counsel"** refers to opposing counsel -- attorneys for Epstein's victims who could exploit Ruemmler's presence to broaden the political dimensions of the case.

### 3. "YOUR NIGERIAN" -- Identification

Based on available evidence, the most likely identification is **Adebayo Ogunlesi**, the Nigerian-American financier who served on the Goldman Sachs Board of Directors. The characteristics described by Epstein -- "a lefty," "predisposed to empower women, minorities" -- combined with Ruemmler's eventual appointment as Goldman Sachs General Counsel, suggest this exchange related to a Goldman Sachs position or a position at another major firm where Ogunlesi or another Nigerian-descent decision-maker had influence.

The timeline (November 2017) precedes Ruemmler's Goldman Sachs appointment (2020) by three years, suggesting either an early-stage discussion or a different position entirely.

### 4. "DEFINITELY HIS FIRST CHOICE" -- AG Nomination Context

The September 30, 2014 exchange ([EFTA02517295](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02517295.pdf)) almost certainly concerned the **U.S. Attorney General** position. On September 26-27, 2014 -- four days before this exchange -- Epstein forwarded a NYT article about Ruemmler as an AG candidate to Staley, Rothschild, Thiel, and Jabor Yousuf ([EFTA00997715](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00997715.pdf)-18). "Money etc." would refer to the pay cut from private practice. "ves said he was very happy" is the source's feedback. The identity of "ves" is unclear.

Epstein was actively promoting Ruemmler's candidacy within his network. The timing of this promotion — circulating the AG article to Staley, Rothschild, Thiel, and Jabor — is consistent with the "first choice" exchange four days later.

### 5. "BENJAMIN" -- Partial Identification

The January 12, 2015 exchange ([EFTA02513986](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02513986.pdf)) discusses "Benjamin," whose father Epstein knew 30 years earlier and who foresaw "a problem was in the future." Ruemmler had "assumed you were exaggerating a bit about Benjamin" but found the characterization accurate upon meeting him. Without additional context, "Benjamin" cannot be definitively identified, but the structure suggests:
- A second-generation associate of Epstein's social circle
- Someone Ruemmler encountered in her professional capacity
- Someone whose behavior was problematic enough to be discussed

### 6. SEALED INDICTMENT (Manafort)

The October 29, 2017 exchange ([EFTA02575359](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02575359.pdf)) precisely coincides with news reports about the first sealed indictment in the Mueller investigation. Paul Manafort and Rick Gates were charged; the sealed indictment was reported on October 28-29, 2017. Epstein turned to Ruemmler for:
- Confirmation of the report's accuracy ("if it is true")
- Legal analysis of prosecutorial strategy ("why would they file a sealed indictment?")

This is consistent with the broader pattern of Epstein consulting Ruemmler on legal developments. Her background as a former DOJ prosecutor (she led the Enron Task Force) and White House Counsel made her well-positioned to interpret such developments.

### 7. RICHARD KAHN CONNECTION

Richard Kahn was Epstein's personal accountant operating through HBRK Associates Inc. at 575 Lexington Avenue, 4th Floor, New York, NY 10022. He managed Epstein's accounts at multiple banks, handled trust structures (including trusts with **Darren Indyke**, referenced frequently as "INDYKE AND RICHARD KAHN" in trust documents), and oversaw wire transfers.

The document [EFTA02066243](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA02066243.pdf) shows internal Epstein organization communications about Ruemmler involving Kahn, confirming she was significant enough to warrant discussion among Epstein's financial/legal inner circle.

## KEY FINDINGS AND IMPLICATIONS

### 1. Duration, Depth, and Fiduciary Duty
The documented relationship spans **at minimum 5 years** (July 2014 to May 2019), with direct email correspondence, calendar entries, and trust documents covering July 2014 through January 2019. This was not a casual acquaintance but a sustained, intimate personal, professional, and **fiduciary** relationship. Ruemmler served as a named Trustee on Epstein's 2018 Trust (May-October 2018 at minimum), with legal authority over his assets.

### 2. Ruemmler as Active Participant
The documents show Ruemmler was not merely a passive recipient of Epstein's overreach. She:
- Initiated contact ("I have another idea")
- Shared photos (St. James Park)
- Provided her personal cell phone number
- Sought Epstein's intelligence about job opportunities
- Visited his home for lunch (July 2016)
- Used his Paris apartment and staff
- Was discussed by name within Epstein's inner circle (Richard Kahn, Bella Klein, Lesley Groff)

### 3. Political Risk Acknowledged and Managed
Epstein explicitly recognized that Ruemmler's association with him could:
- Damage her reputation as a "role model for women"
- Create "unnecessary implication" linking Epstein to Clinton and Obama
- Be exploited by "publicity seeking lawyers" representing Epstein's victims

Despite this acknowledgment, the relationship continued for years afterward.

### 4. Goldman Sachs General Counsel Implications
Ruemmler's 2020 appointment as Goldman Sachs General Counsel came after years of documented communication with a convicted sex offender who was a Goldman Sachs client (Epstein's financial accounts were managed through several major banks). The November 2017 "your Nigerian" exchange shows Epstein was actively coaching Ruemmler on a hiring opportunity that may or may not have been related to this eventual appointment (the 3-year gap between the exchange and the Goldman Sachs appointment is notable).

### 5. Material Benefits
Ruemmler received concrete material benefits including free use of Epstein's Paris luxury apartment, personal driver, personal chef services, and social introductions to high-value contacts (Nobel Committee chair, unidentified "Ken," etc.).

### 6. Bilateral Information Exchange
Epstein consulted Ruemmler for her legal expertise on federal proceedings (Mueller investigation, sealed indictments), while she sought his input on career opportunities (job offers, hiring decisions). This reciprocal exchange of professional information and advice characterized the relationship's practical utility for both parties.

## DS9/DS11 EXPANDED FINDINGS (Full-Text Corpus Revisit)

### Trustee of the Jeffrey E. Epstein 2018 Trust

Ruemmler was a **named Trustee** on the Jeffrey E. Epstein 2018 Trust, alongside Darren K. Indyke and Richard D. Kahn:

- **[EFTA00099449](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00099449.pdf) (DS9):** Trust agreement: "DARREN K. INDYKE, RICHARD D. KAHN, and KATHERYN H. RUEMMLER, as Trustees" -- dated May 8, 2018. Signature page bears notarized "Kathryn H. Ruemmler, Trustee."
- **[EFTA00099447](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00099447.pdf) (DS9):** First Amendment to 2018 Trust (October 2018): Ruemmler still listed as Trustee. This amendment added provisions for Karyna Shuliak's distributions.
- The 2019 Trust (dated January 18, 2019) lists only Indyke and Kahn as trustees. Ruemmler was removed between October 2018 and January 2019 -- coinciding with the Miami Herald's November 28, 2018 "Perversion of Justice" series.

This is a formal fiduciary duty, not merely a social connection. Ruemmler was legally empowered to manage Epstein's assets during this period.

### 20+ Calendar Entries: Relationship Began July 2014

The DS9 Lesley Groff calendar corpus reveals at least 20 previously undocumented in-person meetings, extending the documented relationship start date from September 2014 to **July 11, 2014** ([EFTA00284924](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00284924.pdf): "1:00pm Lunch w/Kathy Ruemmler") -- just two months after she left the White House. Key entries include:

- **Jul 11, 2014:** 10:15am Leon Black, 1:00pm Kathy Ruemmler (same day)
- **Aug 19, 2014:** "12:00pm Lunch w/Kathy Ruemmler (MM) Sushi, Avocado Rolls"
- **Jan 21, 2015:** "8:00pm Appt w/Kathy Ruemmler (snacks)"
- **Jul 19-21, 2015:** "Kathy Ruemmler & Ariane de Rothschild along w/Setvine? Hamad? Cynthia? Henri? Summers? Shabaz?" -- multi-day meeting with tentative guest list
- **Sep 28, 2015:** "8 for dinner . ehud, nilli terje mongolian pres. peter attia. kathy ruemmler. mongolian fm." -- dinner with the President of Mongolia, Ehud Barak, and Terje Rod-Larsen
- **Oct 13, 2015:** 11:00am Ruemmler, 2:00pm Leon Black, 4:30pm Ruemmler (two meetings same day, bracketing Black)
- **Jan 14, 2016:** "Kathy Ruemmler is on the 1pm shuttle from DC to NY tomorrow...she will come straight from LGA to the house for around 3:30 meeting with Ariane, Cynthia, Marc"
- **Feb 13, 2016:** Mandarin Oriental spa booking: "Ruemmler Kathy, Saturday, February 13, 2016, 01:30 PM, Therapeutic - 80 Minutes" ([EFTA00283634](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00283634.pdf))
- **Apr 9, 2018:** Ruemmler to Groff: "I am going to come by and see Jeffrey this afternoon. Would 4 pm be a good time?" ([EFTA00471886](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00471886.pdf))

### Wigdor Law / MeToo Defense Cases

DS11 contains the complete Wigdor Law case exchange (May and October 2018), confirming Ruemmler was actively handling sexual misconduct defense cases while discussing them with Epstein:

- **[EFTA02449539](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02449539.pdf) (May 4, 2018):** Ruemmler: "Effort to go off the grid totally thwarted by another Me too crisis -- this one for Ernst & Young." Epstein: "besides casucci. another wigdor!"
- **[EFTA02449716](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02449716.pdf):** Ruemmler: "Of course, I get brought in AFTER Casucci debacle." Epstein: "your new calling."
- **[EFTA02620106](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02620106.pdf) (Oct 22-23, 2018):** Ruemmler: "Resolved it for a price well below the client's walk away so they are thrilled." Epstein: "cool, how did the wigdor end up?" Ruemmler: "No because I was at Wigdor until after 6 pm. Meeting him tomorrow. Google looks like 11/1."

### Apple Watch Hermes Gift (November-December 2018)

DS9 and DS11 document Epstein's mass Apple Watch gifting operation in November-December 2018:

- **[EFTA00285604](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00285604.pdf) / [EFTA02262535](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02262535.pdf):** Ruemmler selected the most expensive option: a $1,399 Apple Watch Hermes ("40 mm, stainless Hermes with bleu indigo swift leather double tour").
- **[EFTA02264159](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02264159.pdf):** Richard Kahn to Groff: "funny how the girls are the big $$ Hermes spenders plus James (1/2 girl) and Kathy.." Groff: "I knew Kathy would want Hermes."
- The watch was billed to HBRK Associates (Epstein's entity) and shipped to Ruemmler's new NYC apartment. She confirmed receipt January 3, 2019: "Yes!!! I got it yesterday. Love it."
- This gift was sent November 23, 2018 -- the same week as the Miami Herald "Perversion of Justice" series (November 28, 2018).

### Ruemmler's Financial Records in FBI Possession

**[EFTA00810614](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00810614.pdf) (DS9):** A complete Merrill Lynch portfolio review for "Kathryn Ruemmler" dated February 4, 2019, totaling $4,414,396 across four accounts. Its presence in the EFTA corpus confirms investigators were examining her finances.

### Ruemmler as Latham & Watkins Attorney on Rothschild NPA

**[EFTA00590334](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00590334.pdf) (DS9):** DOJ Tax Division letter addressed to "Kathryn Ruemmler, Christopher Clark, Latham & Watkins LLP" regarding Edmond de Rothschild (Suisse) SA Non-Prosecution Agreement, December 10, 2015. Signature block: "KATHRYN RUEMMLER, Latham & Watkins LLP." This confirms Ruemmler, introduced to the Rothschilds by Epstein, was the named attorney who approved the $45.245M penalty NPA.
