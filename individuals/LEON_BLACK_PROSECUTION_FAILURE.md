# LEON BLACK: THE COMPLETE PROSECUTION FAILURE TIMELINE
## How SDNY and Manhattan DA Failed to Charge Despite Multiple Victims and $62.5M Settlement

---

## OVERVIEW

The Epstein files contain a complete record of the Leon Black criminal investigation (2021-2024):
- Multiple victims coming forward with sexual assault allegations
- SDNY declining to open a separate investigation
- Manhattan DA running parallel investigation but never charging
- A victim's direct text accusing Black of rape, sex trafficking, and forced NDA
- $62.5M USVI settlement (July 2023) not triggering criminal charges
- Brad Edwards (prominent Epstein victims' attorney) allegedly retained BY Leon Black
- A video of the victim circulating on a sex site
- Wigdor Law providing journals, photos, and evidence to SDNY for years

**UPDATE (2026-02-12):** Full-text corpus revisit against DS9 and DS11 reveals that the original report, constructed exclusively from DS12 documents (EFTA02731xxx series), captured only the prosecution's procedural timeline. DS9 contains the foundational evidence that prosecutors had in hand but failed to act upon -- including an FBI 302 from April 2020, a 6-page DANY interview from September 2020, a complete DANY-SDNY investigation email chain with a second victim's interview notes, Deutsche Bank transaction charts documenting $118M+ in Black-to-Epstein wire transfers, Epstein's fee dispute letter to Black claiming entitlement to $50-60M, 30+ calendar entries showing Epstein-Black meetings spanning 2013-2016, and complete corporate governance records for BV70 LLC and Elysium Management. DS11 adds Epstein-Ruemmler email exchanges tracking Wigdor firm cases in 2018. These findings are detailed in a new "DS9/DS11 Evidence" section below.

## TIMELINE

**Note:** The timeline below was originally constructed from DS12 documents only. DS9 evidence (see "DS9/DS11 Evidence" section) reveals that the FBI had victim testimony from April 2020 and DANY had detailed interview notes from September 2020 -- meaning there were 12-14 months of inaction before the "Maxwell spinoff" referenced below.

### April 2020: FBI 302 -- First Victim Interview (DS9: [EFTA00079370](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00079370.pdf))
An FBI 302 from case file 50D-NY-3027571 documents a victim interview. The victim described meeting Leon Black in 2008 while modeling, being sexually abused, flown to Epstein's Florida home, and told Black "ran a sex trafficking ring." She stated Black transferred $10 million to Epstein after she signed an NDA under duress. She was introduced to Ghislaine Maxwell and Prince Andrew. Multiple copies exist in DS9 ([EFTA00087968](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00087968.pdf), [EFTA00090606](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00090606.pdf), [EFTA00103694](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00103694.pdf), [EFTA00152747](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00152747.pdf), [EFTA00173803](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00173803.pdf)).

### September 2020: ADA Saxtein Interview (DS9: [EFTA01246230](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA01246230.pdf))
ADA Leah Saxtein's 6-page interview notes document the same victim's detailed account to the Manhattan DA, including violent sexual assaults, a forced NDA, surveillance, and harassment by named individuals including Harry Dubin, Mort Zuckerman, Harvey Weinstein, Alex Von Furstenberg, and Len Blavatnik. The interview also documents the $10M transfer to Epstein.

### May 2021: Maxwell Spinoff ([EFTA02731604](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2012/EFTA02731604.pdf)/[EFTA02731578](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2012/EFTA02731578.pdf))
SDNY AUSA to FBI CEHT: "We'd like to ask you to interview a witness that would be a spin-off from the Maxwell case, in order to decide whether we should open an investigation."

FBI interviews victim (who needed interpreter) on May 18 with attorney Jeanne Christensen.

AUSA requests Leon Black 302s. Internal email: "I'm not inclined to open based on the other victim, for a variety of reasons, but just want to make sure I'm doing my due diligence."

KEY: "Two victims from the Epstein investigation who were assaulted by Black and discussed it during their initial FBI interviews" already existed. The Wigdor client made at least THREE victims. **UPDATE (2026-02-12):** DS9 evidence ([EFTA00156644](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00156644.pdf)) identifies a further victim who came forward in 2023, trafficked through a "Mary" intermediary, describing violent assault by Black when she was approximately 17 years old in 2001. This brings the documented victim count to at least four, with additional victims referenced in the 302.

### Aug 2021: Defer to Post-Trial ([EFTA02731618](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2012/EFTA02731618.pdf))
SDNY: "[Supervisor] prefers we wait until after the trial to interview this new victim." AUSA: "I'd like to do that so it doesn't seem like we are just rebuffing the victim."

### Oct-Nov 2021: Manhattan DA Takes Over ([EFTA02731583](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2012/EFTA02731583.pdf)/623/628)
ADAs Alissa Wimmer and Vanessa Puzio (Manhattan DA) contact SDNY about their parallel Black investigation. ADA Leah Saxtein had prior contact.

### Jan 2022: SDNY Declines ([EFTA02731583](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2012/EFTA02731583.pdf))
"We don't have any current plans to interview [victim] again... If you are still pursuing an investigation encompassing both victims, we are not likely to open another investigation."

### Feb 2023: Fourth Victim ([EFTA02731587](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2012/EFTA02731587.pdf)/593)
Manhattan DA: "We have a new CW who has come forward and alleged sexual abuse by Leon Black. This CW was trafficked by Maxwell and Epstein."

SDNY response (June 2023): "I was hoping to try to evaluate whether we'd be inclined to investigate the conduct before circling back to her."

### Jul 2023: $62.5M Settlement ([EFTA02731648](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2012/EFTA02731648.pdf))
Christensen (Wigdor) to SDNY: "Leon Black paid 62.5 million to USVI - and this does not include payments to individual women - it's outrageous that criminal charges have not been brought. I've heard one lawyer represents ten women that he sexually assaulted."

### Mar 2024: Video Allegation ([EFTA02731515](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2012/EFTA02731515.pdf))
Christensen: "I strongly believe that there is at least one video circulating on some disgusting sex site with [victim]. [She] told me she was videotaped at a hotel... I know the names of at least two of the men who she had to have sex with during this incident - there were 6 men there and she had to be with 3 of them. One is a former friend of Leon Black's."

Victim was contacted by online gamer who recognized her from a video showing "one girl having sex with 3 men in a row."

### Mar 2024: Photos from Martha's Vineyard ([EFTA02731490](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2012/EFTA02731490.pdf)/501)
"JE at the side of the boat with a young woman with blond hair... Maxwell who took these four photos. They stayed overnight just one night. It is clearly Oak Bluffs harbor on MV."

Shared: 2012 journal (entirety + typed translation), "more than 20 people who wrote in her journal contemporaneously."

### Oct 2024: Brad Edwards Problem ([EFTA02731577](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2012/EFTA02731577.pdf))
Wigdor call notes: "Black retained Edwards as part of a legal settlement of allegations... There have been other instances where a victim's attorney has been hired by the defendant."

## VICTIM'S DIRECT TEXT TO LEON BLACK ([EFTA02731576](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2012/EFTA02731576.pdf))

> "Leon. You sexually harassed me, sex trafficked me, raped me, and eventually blacklisted me. I don't know for how much longer it will take me to process the pain you caused to me and my family. The least thing you can do is to give me that document that I was forced to sign under duress and wasn't able to read before signing. Unfortunately I am still tied to you..."

## DS9/DS11 EVIDENCE (Added 2026-02-12)

The following evidence was identified during a full-text corpus revisit against DS9 (531,284 pages) and DS11 (331,655 pages). It substantially expands the evidentiary record beyond the DS12 documents that formed the basis of the original report.

### Financial Scope: $118M+ Documented Wire Transfers

DS9 contains "EXHIBIT A: LEON BLACK / ROTHSCHILD GROUP TRANSACTIONS" ([EFTA00080260](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00080260.pdf)), a complete wire transfer chart documenting $118M+ in direct Black-to-Epstein payments (2013-2017). Selected entries:

| Date | Payer | Recipient | Amount |
|------|-------|-----------|--------|
| 10/15/2013 | Leon and Debra Black | Southern Trust Company | $8,500,000 |
| 12/18/2013 | Black Family Partners c/o Apollo | Southern Trust Company | $10,000,000 |
| 7/15/2014 | Narrow Holdings LLC c/o Elysium | Southern Trust Company | $20,000,000 |
| 12/30/2015 | Leon and Debra Black c/o Apollo | Southern Trust Company | $10,000,000 |
| 3/31/2017 | BV70 LLC | Plan D, LLC | $22,500,000 |
| 4/17/2017 | BV70 LLC | Plan D, LLC | $8,000,000 |

The original report referenced the $62.5M USVI settlement; DS9 reveals documented wire transfers exceeding that figure by nearly double.

### Epstein's Fee Dispute Letter ([EFTA00285298](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00285298.pdf))

A multi-page letter from Epstein to Black, referencing a transaction that made Black "$600 million after tax," in which Epstein proposed to "discount the fee as per our agreement to a 50 - 60 million range." This documents Epstein's claimed entitlement to $50-60M from a single transaction and references the $30M BV70 loan structure.

### Corporate Governance: BV70 and Elysium ([EFTA00599517](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00599517.pdf))

DS9 contains the complete Black family entity governance chart: BV70 LLC (Member: Leon D. Black), Elysium Management LLC (Managing Directors: Leon D. Black, Brad Wechsler), Narrow Holdings LLC (Leon D. Black 100%), and Friends Ventures LLC (Leon D. Black and Ronald S. Lauder). Epstein personally guaranteed BV70 LLC loans of $22.5M and $8M ([EFTA00583120](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00583120.pdf), [EFTA00594105](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00594105.pdf)).

### DANY-SDNY Investigation Email Chain ([EFTA00156644](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00156644.pdf))

A 10-page document showing the complete coordination between DANY and SDNY from October 2021 through July 2023, including detailed interview notes about a different victim trafficked through a "Mary" intermediary. SDNY consistently declined to investigate: "we are not likely to open another investigation" (January 2022).

### Calendar Entries: 30+ Epstein-Black Meetings (EFTA00284xxx-EFTA00293xxx series)

Calendar entries document the frequency of contact, including meetings at Apollo offices with Paul Morris (Deutsche Bank), lunches with Leon Black and Brad Wechsler, Elysium Trustees Meetings, and same-day meetings with Kathy Ruemmler. Notable pattern: Paul Morris (Deutsche Bank) frequently appears on the same day as Leon Black meetings.

### Epstein-Ruemmler Wigdor Emails (DS11)

DS11 reveals Epstein tracking Wigdor firm cases in 2018 with Kathy Ruemmler: "besides casucci. another wigdor!" (May 2018, [EFTA02449539](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02449539.pdf)) and "how did the wigdor end up?" (October 2018, [EFTA02620106](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02620106.pdf)). The same firm later represented victims against Black.

### SDNY Awareness ([EFTA00077262](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00077262.pdf))

A February 2021 SDNY public information office email forwarding a NYT inquiry about "leon black and taxes," with the public affairs officer noting staff had "no idea whether this is something on anyone's radar" -- suggesting the criminal investigation was not prioritized internally.
