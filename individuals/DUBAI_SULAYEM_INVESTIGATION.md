# EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Sultan Ahmed bin Sulayem, Chairman and Group CEO of DP World (the world's largest port operator, headquartered in Dubai), maintained a deep, sustained, and multi-faceted relationship with Jeffrey Epstein spanning at least 2009-2019 -- a full decade that continued through Epstein's post-conviction period and up to five months before his July 2019 arrest. Over 5,000 documents across all DOJ datasets reference this relationship. The documentary evidence reveals not merely a social connection, but a relationship in which Epstein functioned as a global geopolitical consultant to DP World, advising on port acquisitions across at least seven countries and brokering introductions to heads of state and senior political figures. Key elements include:

1. **Port of St. Croix** -- Epstein pitched the port opportunity to Sultan on September 6, 2014 ([EFTA00626038](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00626038.pdf)): "I think I could also get us federal funds to help build." Sultan responded: "If we invest I will have a reason to regularly visit you." Sultan then directed DP World Americas SVP Matthew Leech to coordinate with Epstein's USVI attorney Erika Kellerhals ([EFTA02517291](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02517291.pdf)). The port discussion continued through at least June 2016, when Sultan requested to "meet the port authority to look again at the port and the cruise terminal" ([EFTA00631662](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00631662.pdf)).
2. **Global geopolitical consulting** -- Epstein advised DP World on port strategy in Cuba, Venezuela, the UK (London Gateway), Congo, Gabon, Rwanda, Senegal, Chile, and the USVI. He offered Bill Richardson as an intermediary for Cuba/Venezuela ports ([EFTA00776743](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00776743.pdf)) and brokered Sultan's meeting with Lord Mandelson at the UK Cabinet Office for the London Gateway port project ([EFTA00769918](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00769918.pdf)).
3. **Financial payments** -- Epstein paid Sultan $6,200 from his Deutsche Bank account on July 18, 2017 ([EFTA00027019](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00027019.pdf))
4. **Access to Dubai's rulers** -- Epstein and Sultan coordinated shipment of **30 DNA ancestry kits** to the Al Maktoum family via Emirates Airlines at JFK ([EFTA00452358](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00452358.pdf)). Epstein also had direct contact information for the Crown Prince of Dubai (Sheikh Hamdan bin Mohammed) in his Mac address book ([EFTA00507137](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00507137.pdf)).
5. **Brokered introductions** -- Epstein brokered meetings between Sultan and Ehud Barak ([EFTA00649997](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00649997.pdf)), Lord Mandelson, Tom Pritzker ([EFTA00439785](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00439785.pdf)), and Joi Ito. In March 2018, Sultan was invited to Epstein's 71st Street residence alongside both Bannon and Barak ([EFTA00856066](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00856066.pdf)).
6. **Island architecture referral** -- Sultan referred a Dubai-based architect (Creative Kingdom, Business Bay, Dubai) to design buildings on Epstein's islands ([EFTA02664965](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02664965.pdf)). The firm progressed to formal USVI permit applications ([EFTA00696090](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00696090.pdf)).
7. **Jan 2019 island meeting** -- Sultan was invited to Epstein's island alongside Steve Bannon, Nicole Junkermann, Eduardo Teodorani, and Jabor Yousef Jassim Al Thani (a member of Qatar's ruling Al Thani family), just five months before arrest ([EFTA02273951](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02273951.pdf))
8. **Photographic evidence** -- A CD-R labeled "LSJ XMAS / Sultan" containing photographs from Little St. James island was seized by investigators ([EFTA00005091](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%203/EFTA00005091.pdf))
9. **Victim testimony** -- A witness/victim identified "a guy from Dubai -- Sultan" in interview notes ([EFTA00021076](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00021076.pdf))

## 1.2 Reconstructed Timeline

### Phase 1: Initial Contact (2009)
- **June 30, 2009**: First documented email from Sultan to Epstein ("Hello my friend, how are you. Please use this email"). This is AFTER Epstein's 2008 conviction and registration as a sex offender, meaning Sultan initiated/maintained contact with a convicted sex offender.

### Phase 2: Integration Period (2010-2011)
- **Oct 2010**: Tom Barrack is in Dubai and communicating with Epstein about Sultan; simultaneously discussing "Nicole" (likely Junkermann). Barrack was later indicted (July 2021) for acting as an unregistered foreign agent for the UAE, but was acquitted on all counts in November 2022.
- **Nov 2011**: Sultan shares full flight itinerary (Dubai-Paris-Beirut-Dubai) with Epstein, indicating closeness.
- **Dec 2010**: Multi-party email chain with subject "Re: Jeffrey Epstein" involving Sultan and multiple others -- suggesting coordination around Epstein's reputation/legal situation.

- **Sept 6, 2014**: **THE PORT GENESIS EMAIL** ([EFTA00626038](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00626038.pdf)) -- Epstein pitches the St. Croix port opportunity to Sultan: "its very intesting, very -- a US port not subject to the Jones act... I think I could also get us federal funds to help build. due to the economicss of the VI, we would also get a us tax break. The governor is very friendly.

Lesley Groff coordinated: "I rec'd a phone call from the airport asking if we would like our package we want sent to Al Maktoum to go on today's direct flight." Sultan arranges collection by "Mike" -- the Emirates supervisor at JFK -- who "received a message from Mohamad Maktoum to expect a box."

# SECTION 2: DP WORLD / PORT CONNECTION SIGNIFICANCE

## 2.1 The Port of St. Croix -- Full Genesis and Ongoing Discussion

The full email trail, revealed through DS9 data, shows the port discussion began 24 days earlier than previously documented and continued for at least two years.

### Genesis Email: September 6, 2014 ([EFTA00626038](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00626038.pdf))

Epstein pitched the port opportunity directly to Sultan:

> "its very intesting, very -- a US port not subject to the Jones act. strange, there was a giant oil co hovensa that left the island, along with an aluminum smelter, all giant ships. I think I could also get us federal funds to help build. due to the economicss of the VI, we would also get a us tax break. The governor is very friendly. I am pulling together info for you. they came to me to invest. not knowing about you at all."

Sultan responded: **"Great that will be helpful If we invest I will have a reason to regularly visit you (:"**

### Full Transshipment Port Chain: September 9, 2014 ([EFTA00693761](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00693761.pdf))

Three days later, Sultan forwarded to Leech: "Dear Mat, Please go through the info as I was contacted to see if we are interested to manage this small port its very interesting a US port not subject to the jones act. There was a giant oil co Hovensa that left the island along with an aluminum smelter. all giant ships used to berth. We also might get us federal funds to help build due to the economicss of the US VI. We would also get a us tax break. The governor is very friendly and very keen to get this port operated." Kellerhals provided detailed port specifications for the Wilfred "Bombe" Allick Port and Transshipment Center in Krause Lagoon, St. Croix.

### Formal Direction: September 30, 2014 ([EFTA02517291](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02517291.pdf))

```

### Ongoing Interest: June 2016 ([EFTA00631662](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00631662.pdf))

After visiting Epstein's island on June 9, 2016, Sultan wrote from the air: "Dear Jeffery I am in the air just left St. John in my route to London... Looking forward to see you may arrange for me to meet the port authority to look again at the port and the cruise terminal." This demonstrates the port discussion was ongoing through at least June 2016 — 20 months after the genesis email.

### 2.1.1 Analysis

This email trail shows:
1. **Epstein originated the port opportunity** by pitching it to Sultan as a tax-advantaged investment
2. **Sultan bin Sulayem personally directed** DP World Americas' SVP Matthew Leech to contact Epstein's USVI lawyer about the Port of St. Croix
3. **Leech confirmed compliance** ("will do")
4. **Anil Wats** was cc'd (DP World executive)
5. **Epstein forwarded the chain** to Kellerhals, confirming a meeting the next day at 10am
6. **The discussion continued for at least two years** (September 2014 through June 2016)

### 2.1.2 Erika Kellerhals Context

Kellerhals was Epstein's primary legal representative in the US Virgin Islands:
- **[EFTA00030126](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00030126.pdf)**: Deed records show "ERIKA KELLERHALS, ESQ" at "9100 HAVENSIGHT, PORT OF SALE, SUITE 15/16" -- the Port of Sale is the cruise ship terminal area in St. Thomas
- **[EFTA02546933](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02546933.pdf)**: "Reminder you have a meeting today with Erika Kellerhals today at FTC at 1:00" (Nov 2011)
- **[EFTA00027019](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00027019.pdf)**: Kellerhals Ferguson Kroblin PLLC received **$23,000,000** from Epstein's Deutsche Bank account on Nov 13, 2015, and another **$75,000** on Feb 2, 2016
- **[EFTA00014367](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00014367.pdf)**: Kellerhals Ferguson Kroblin was the law firm handling Epstein's purchase of Great St. James island through Great St. Jim, LLC

### 2.1.3 DP World's Port Operations Near Epstein's Islands

DP World is the world's largest port operator, controlling ports in over 40 countries. The US Virgin Islands are a critical nexus for Caribbean shipping. The Port of St. Croix (and nearby Port of Sale in St. Thomas) handle both commercial cargo and cruise traffic.

Epstein's islands (Little St. James and Great St. James) are located in the harbor area near St. Thomas. **Control of or influence over port operations in this area would provide:**
- Oversight of cargo and passenger movements
- Ability to influence customs inspection protocols
- Knowledge of shipping schedules and vessel movements
- Infrastructure for moving goods/people with reduced scrutiny

## 2.2 Epstein's Documented CBP/Customs Issues

The files contain extensive CBP (Customs and Border Protection) records:
- **[EFTA00010062](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00010062.pdf)**: CBP TECS records showing Epstein's travel through "CBP-ST THOMAS, VI PREFLIGHT" and "CBP-CYRIL E KING, INTL AIRPORT"
- **[EFTA00018023](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00018023.pdf)**: "RE: CBP Question" -- prosecutors reviewing all travel records, noting "outbound travel records were not recorded in CBP database during that time (between 1990-2000)"
- **[EFTA00010069](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00010069.pdf)-[EFTA00010083](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00010083.pdf)**: Extensive CBP encounter records for Epstein through multiple ports of entry
- **[EFTA00010341](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00010341.pdf)-[EFTA00010345](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00010345.pdf)**: Epstein's passport and TECS records

The gap in outbound CBP records (1990-2000) overlaps with the period during which Epstein's trafficking activity has been documented through other sources (victim testimony, flight logs).

## 2.3 The DP World-Russia Connection

Sultan sent Epstein a Khaleej Times article about DP World expanding into Russia ([EFTA01802972](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01802972.pdf), Sept 2015). This is notable because DP World was pursuing Russian port concessions during the same period.

## 2.4 Epstein as DP World Geopolitical Consultant

DS9 data reveals an aspect of the relationship barely hinted at in the original analysis: Epstein functioned as a strategic geopolitical consultant to Sultan and DP World, advising on port acquisitions across multiple continents.

### Cuba/Venezuela Port Strategy (2009-2010)

**[EFTA00738521](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00738521.pdf)** (Aug 13, 2009): Epstein advised Sultan on the Venezuelan port seizure: "Grupo Empresarial de La Industria Portuaria is a cuban corp that is behind the port takeover. they are making a joint venture with chavez to control both countries ports and raise prices. They are your trouble not venezuela. The end game should be, trying to operate all the ports for both countries. IT will take some time. you should personally concentrate on cuba."

**[EFTA00738547](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00738547.pdf)** (Aug 14, 2009): Epstein on Chavez psychology: "I would suggest, the meeting with uribe, would depend on its reason. chavez is very emotional, he could decide, like a jealous girl, that he wants to be your partner, instead of uribe."

**[EFTA00773721](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00773721.pdf)** (Aug 17, 2009): Sultan relays to Anil Wats, Jamal Majid Bin Thaniah (DP World Vice Chairman), and Epstein: "He spoke to chavez today, he advises that I should travel to cuba in October after chavez speech in the united nations."

**[EFTA00776743](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00776743.pdf)** (Nov 28, 2010): Epstein offered Bill Richardson -- who was separately a subject in the Epstein trafficking investigation -- as a business intermediary for DP World: "THe Former Sec of Energy and Us Ambassador to the UN Bill Richardson. Is close to both chavez and castro (raul). He would be happy to work on your behalf re the ports in both cuba and venezuela."

### London Gateway / Lord Mandelson (2009)

Epstein brokered the relationship between DP World and the UK government regarding the London Gateway port project:

- **[EFTA00750590](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00750590.pdf)** (July 12, 2009): Epstein to Sultan: "mandelson is in london" -- real-time intelligence sharing about the UK Secretary of State.
- **[EFTA00741826](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00741826.pdf)** (Nov 9, 2009): Epstein to Sultan: "This is his government email -- sultan, send it to his personal email. do not give it to anyone else" regarding Mandelson's contact details.
- **[EFTA00880531](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00880531.pdf)** (Sept 7, 2009): Epstein forwarded Sultan's email directly to Peter Mandelson -- confirming Epstein as the intermediary.
- **[EFTA00769918](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00769918.pdf)**: Sultan's meeting with Lord Mandelson (then UK Secretary of State for Business) at Cabinet Office on September 16, 2009 at 4pm for 45 minutes.
- **[EFTA00768289](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00768289.pdf)** (Nov 5, 2009): Sultan sent Epstein the formal DP World letter to Mandelson about the London Gateway Port project, invoking "the imminent state visit of H.H Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid al Maktoum."
- **[EFTA00768606](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00768606.pdf)** (Nov 11, 2009): Mandelson's office responded -- and Sultan forwarded the response to Epstein.

### Africa Strategy (2011-2013)

**[EFTA00656580](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00656580.pdf)** (April 2011): Epstein proposed an Africa trip: "can we plan a trip, to africa early may. senegal, gabon, mali, benin. marrakash. -paris."

**[EFTA00632171](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00632171.pdf)** (May 2013): Sultan to Epstein after his Africa tour: "Had a great and very successful trip to Congo Kinshasa, Gabon, Rwanda. I met president Kabila I discussed port investment which he welcomes. he want to give us investment in mining and oil and gas. I mentioned to him that I have an American fund manager who will visit with me next time he welcomed that very much." Sultan told the President of the DRC that Epstein was "an American fund manager" who would visit alongside him.

### Chile / Panama Canal (2013)

**[EFTA00964765](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00964765.pdf)** (July 2013): Sultan forwarded to Epstein the approach from Andronico Luksic Craig ($20B Chilean billionaire, Panama Canal Authority advisory committee member) seeking a meeting. Sultan asked Epstein: "Do you know anything on this guy."

# SECTION 4: DUBAI/UAE BROADER CONNECTIONS

## 4.1 Abu Dhabi Forum Attendance (Nov 2010)

**[EFTA02317853](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02317853.pdf)** -- Sarah Kellen email from Abu Dhabi:
```
Greetings from Abu Dhabi!! I am in the middle of the desert at a hotel filled
with foreign prime ministers, sheiks and the like. It's crazy. They have taken
over the whole hotel for this forum they are having which JE was invited to!
I am on the list of attendants under "Business Expert".
Someone asked JE what I was an expert in and he said hunger.
Now they think I'm an expert in world hunger.
```

This places Epstein at a high-level UAE forum in November 2010, with access to "foreign prime ministers, sheiks" -- likely the Abu Dhabi Media Summit or similar elite gathering.

## 4.2 Tom Barrack as Dubai Intermediary

Tom Barrack, founder of Colony Capital, served as a crucial intermediary between Epstein's network and Dubai/Gulf interests:

- **[EFTA02418502](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02418502.pdf)**: Barrack in Dubai, discussing Sultan and Nicole simultaneously
- **[EFTA02418501](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02418501.pdf)**: Ghislaine Maxwell asking about Barrack: "What's Tom Barrack's story -- have a good friend of mine whose crazy for him"
- **[EFTA02422168](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02422168.pdf)**: Lesley Groff coordinating "Tom Barrack-Ehud Barak" meeting

**Critical context**: Tom Barrack was subsequently indicted in July 2021 on charges of acting as an unregistered foreign agent for the UAE, obstruction of justice, and making false statements to the FBI. He was **acquitted on all counts** in November 2022 after a nearly two-month federal trial. While the acquittal means Barrack was not found to have acted as a foreign agent, the prosecution's case — which alleged he used access to Trump to promote UAE interests — documented his intermediary role between US and Gulf interests during the same period he appeared in Epstein's orbit.

## 4.3 Epstein's Dubai Travel Plans

**[EFTA01775318](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01775318.pdf)** (Redaction v2):
```
"going to dubai to see su[ltan]"
"then maybe abu d[habi]"
"invited to saudi bu[t]..."
```

This shows Epstein planning a Gulf tour: Dubai (to see Sultan) --> Abu Dhabi --> Saudi Arabia. A comprehensive Gulf engagement strategy.

## 4.4 Dubai Clothes for Island Guests

**[EFTA02439362](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02439362.pdf)** (June 2009):
```
Epstein: "I don't think they would wear it by choice. All the dubai clothes
& robes never got used."
```

This reveals Epstein had purchased Dubai-style clothing and robes for island guests -- suggesting he hosted enough Dubai/Gulf visitors that he procured traditional garments for their comfort.

## 4.5 Al Maktoum Royal Family Connections

### 30 DNA Ancestry Kits ([EFTA00452358](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00452358.pdf))

The original report documented a single 23andMe kit discussion. DS9 reveals the scale was far greater:

**May 23, 2017**: Lesley Groff email chain: "I rec'd a phone call from the airport asking if we would like our package we want sent to Al Maktoum to go on today's direct flight out to Dubai at 11:20am." Epstein clarified: "did we get the package it is thirty ancestor kits dna." Sultan arranged collection: "Mike will collect it and take it to airport and send it with a cabin crew to Dubai." Mike was identified as "the supervisor at Emirates at JFK airport" who "received a message from Mohamad Maktoum to expect a box."

**July 15, 2017** ([EFTA02644753](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02644753.pdf)):
```
Epstein to Sultan: "should we send sheikh mo a 23 and me kit?"
Sultan: "He has it already or did they cancel it"
Epstein: "did you find yours? are you part jewish?"
```

"Sheikh Mo" is Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, the ruler of Dubai and Vice President/Prime Minister of the UAE. The 30-kit shipment to the Al Maktoum family connects to Epstein's documented interest in genetics and DNA testing (see also the DNA kits discussed in the Rothschild and Junkermann reports).

### Crown Prince of Dubai Contact

Forensic extraction from Epstein's Mac (NYC024328) shows a contact entry for "Crown Prince of Dubai Chairman Of The Executive Councel" created March 4, 2018 ([EFTA00507137](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00507137.pdf)). A separate device shows "Shaikh Hamdan Bin Mohammed Bin Rashid Al Maktoum" ([EFTA00512555](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00512555.pdf)). Staff also had the Crown Prince's cell numbers for both UAE and US ([EFTA00434212](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00434212.pdf)). This represents a second tier of Dubai royal access beyond Sultan's relationship with Sheikh Mohammed.

## 4.6 The Joi Ito-Sultan-Dubai Connection (August 2013)

**[EFTA00678475](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00678475.pdf)**: Extended Epstein-Joi Ito email chain about Sultan (August 27-29, 2013). Ito reported: "I talked to Sultan's guy that he assigned to me. I guess he's going to stick with me during my trip and take care of me. Sharaf? Do you know him?" Epstein responded: "yes, hes great. funny and trustworthy, sheik mo's right hand. speaks perfect english, educated temple university and a FOODIE" -- describing Mohammed Sharaf, DP World CEO. Epstein characterized Sultan: "sultan has amazing energy, sleeps little." Ito asked: "Assume I should meet him alone and not with my little punk girl sidekick right?" This shows Epstein arranged VIP treatment for MIT Media Lab Director Joi Ito in Dubai through Sultan, connecting the science/tech network with the Dubai port infrastructure network.

## 4.7 Dubai-Based Architecture for Epstein's Islands

**[EFTA02664965](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02664965.pdf)** (Dec 28-29, 2016):
```
Epstein to Eduardo Robles (Creative Kingdom, Business Bay, Dubai):
"I've gotten your name from sultan suleiman in Dubai. He and I are
great friends. I have two islands in the US Virgin Islands and want
to build a great home. Sultan thought you might be the right fit."
```

Robles responded enthusiastically, planning to travel through Asia to New York and then to St. Thomas to assess the islands. Follow-up in **[EFTA02387631](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02387631.pdf)** (March 2017) shows the "st james" project continued.

**Significance**: Sultan was actively facilitating Epstein's island development by referring professionals from his Dubai network -- demonstrating the operational nature of the relationship.

# SECTION 5: MC2 / DANIEL SIAD -- DUBAI-BASED RECRUITMENT ACTIVITY

## 5.1 Daniel Siad -- "Scout" and Recruiter

Daniel Siad was explicitly described by Jean-Luc Brunel as a "scout" or recruiter of girls/women for Epstein:

**[EFTA00017956](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00017956.pdf)** (FBI/AUSA document, Dec 2018):
```
"Yesterday I spoke of Daniel Siad, whom Jean Luc Brunel describes as a
'scout' or recruiter of girls and/or women for J Epstein."
```

### 5.1.1 Siad's Documented Activities

- **[EFTA02432663](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02432663.pdf)** (Dec 24, 2009): Siad to Epstein: "I am here in Koh Samui with Eva... she is from Slovakia... I could place her with jean luc in Miami because she is already with next in NY" -- sending model portfolio links
- **[EFTA02439449](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02439449.pdf)** (June 20, 2009): "More pictures" -- sending model photos including Lana Zakocela (Latvian model)
- **[EFTA01796033](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01796033.pdf)** (Mar 15, 2011): Email exchange
- **[EFTA01975079](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01975079.pdf)**: Epstein to Siad with cc to "Lesle Gro[ff]"
- **[EFTA01976769](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01976769.pdf)**: From Daniel Siad
- **[EFTA01986452](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01986452.pdf)**: Siad to Jean Luc Brunel: "Commission de mes 2 filles Chez toi" ("Commission for my 2 girls at your place")

### 5.1.2 Siad's Dubai Base

**[EFTA02571027](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02571027.pdf)** (June 10, 2013):
```
Daniel Siad to Epstein:
"I am on my way to Thailand then Vietnam with Khaled Ben Nacer Al Masned.
He is the brother [of] Moza from Qatar, I have been assisting him lately.
I am happy to get out Paris the fashion industry there is sax [sic].
I am looking to build up something here in Dubai."
```

**Key connections**:
- **Khaled Ben Nacer Al Masned**: Brother of Sheikha Moza bint Nasser, the powerful mother of the Emir of Qatar
- Siad was connected to Qatari royalty while also working for Epstein/Brunel
- He was relocating from Paris to Dubai, establishing a new base of operations

### 5.1.3 Amar Siad -- The Emirates Connection

Multiple documents reference "AMAR SIAD at EMIRATES":
- **[EFTA01386384](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01386384.pdf)**: "AMAR SIAD at EMIRATE"
- **[EFTA01387625](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01387625.pdf)**: "AMAR SIAD at EMIRATES"
- **[EFTA01433744](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01433744.pdf)**: "AMAR SIAD at EMIRATE"
- **[EFTA01763533](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01763533.pdf)**: "Accept Daniel Amar Siad's Invitation"

"Amar Siad" appears to be either Daniel Siad's full name or a family member working at **Emirates Airlines**. The nature of Amar Siad's role and any connection to Epstein/Brunel activities beyond the LinkedIn invitation is not established in the released documents.

---

# SECTION 6: SAUDI/MBS CONNECTIONS THROUGH BANNON

## 6.1 The MBS-Jared Breakfast

**[EFTA02518865](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02518865.pdf)** (Feb 28, 2018):
```
Epstein to Bannon: "MBS coming to wash 19th"
Bannon to Epstein: "To have breakfast with Jared"
```

This exchange shows Epstein was tracking Mohammed bin Salman's (MBS) visit to Washington and Bannon confirmed it was to meet Jared Kushner. The casual nature of this intelligence sharing is remarkable.

## 6.2 Hope Hicks and Nick Ribis Discussion

**[EFTA02518894](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02518894.pdf)** (Feb 28, 2018) -- same day:
```
Bannon: "I think hope maybe getting indicted"
Epstein: "Hope gone. Don Jr spittoon. I'm on cell"
Epstein: "Nick Ribis loyal, lawyer. Knows Donald 25 years, and shares
Kasowitz expertise"
Bannon: "What firm"
Epstein: "Nick was the person that negotiated Donald out of bankruptcy. Not Wilbur"
Bannon: "Got it"
Bannon: "Got pulled into a meeting in the city. Trying to get some ambassadors confirmed"
```

This shows Epstein exchanging political information with Bannon about administration personnel and legal matters.

## 6.3 Gulf Tour Plans

**[EFTA01775318](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01775318.pdf)**: Epstein's planned Gulf tour -- Dubai, Abu Dhabi, Saudi Arabia -- shows a systematic engagement with all three major Gulf power centers.

## 6.4 Bannon's Separate UAE/Gulf Connections

Bannon had his own Gulf relationships:
- Connected to MBS through the Trump administration
- Later charged in "We Build the Wall" fraud ([EFTA00021251](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00021251.pdf): SDNY news clips)
- His phone was seized by FBI, revealing texts with Epstein and a photo of Trump with Ghislaine Maxwell

# SECTION 7: FINANCIAL FLOWS

## 7.1 Direct Payment: Epstein to Sultan

**[EFTA00027019](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00027019.pdf)** -- Deutsche Bank Wire Transfer Records:
```
7/18/2017  Sultan Bin Sulayem  $6,200  DB-SDNY-0006349
```

This payment from Epstein's Deutsche Bank account to Sultan bin Sulayem is listed among significant wire transfers. While small relative to other payments on the ledger (which include $2M+ monthly transfers to Jeepers Inc. and a $23M payment to Kellerhals Ferguson), its existence is significant:
- It documents a **direct financial relationship**
- The amount ($6,200) could represent reimbursement, a gift, or a small payment
- It occurs 3 days after the "Sheikh Mo 23andMe" email exchange

## 7.2 Kellerhals Ferguson PLLC Payments

The same financial document shows massive payments to Epstein's USVI law firm:
- **Nov 13, 2015**: $23,000,000 to Kellerhals Ferguson Kroblin PLLC
- **Feb 2, 2016**: $75,000 to Kellerhals Ferguson Kroblin PLLC

This is the same firm and attorney (Erika Kellerhals) that Sultan's DP World was directed to contact about the Port of St. Croix.

## 7.3 Adjacent Financial Entities

Key payments from the same ledger:
- Multiple $2M monthly payments to Jeepers Inc. (Epstein brokerage entity)
- $170,000 to Seed Media Group (Adam Bly)
- $1,000,000 to Stone & Magnanini LLP
- $50,000 payments to Delson International Inc.
- $100,000 to Jamie Mitchell
- Payments to NLR Resorts International LLC ($50K + $25K + $25K)
- $20,000,000 to The Haze Trust (DB Brokerage Account)

# SECTION 8: VICTIM/WITNESS TESTIMONY

## 8.1 "Guy from Dubai -- Sultan"

**[EFTA00021076](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00021076.pdf)** contains extensive handwritten/transcribed notes from what appears to be a victim/witness interview. Among the individuals identified:

```
"guy from Dubai -- Sultan"
"Andrew Farcus [Farkas] introduced"
```

This places Sultan bin Sulayem in the testimony of a victim/witness, alongside Andrew Farkas (real estate executive who appears on Epstein's schedules). The witness describes Sultan being introduced to them in a context that is part of a longer narrative about encounters with various individuals in Epstein's world.

The same document contains extensive descriptions of:
- Massage scheduling and encounters
- Travel to multiple Epstein residences (NY, Palm Beach, Virgin Islands)
- Cash payments ("piles of $100 bills", "$1000 petty cash")
- Instructions not to talk to police
- Threats ("if I scream or say no... I'm on island nowhere to go")
- References to Jean-Luc Brunel and travel to Russia with "Sean Luc"
- References to Cuba travel

---

# SECTION 9: PROSECUTORIAL SIGNIFICANCE

## 9.1 Why This Matters

### Port Infrastructure Connection
DP World controls customs and logistics infrastructure at ports worldwide. The documented connection between DP World's chairman and Epstein — including the specific Port of St. Croix discussion near Epstein's islands — is notable given the USVI's role in Epstein's operations. However, no evidence in the released documents indicates that port infrastructure was used to facilitate any illegal activity. The port discussion, as documented in the emails, appears to concern a standard commercial port management opportunity.

### CBP Records Gaps
The files document that CBP outbound travel records were not maintained for the period 1990-2000 ([EFTA00018023](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00018023.pdf)). This gap overlaps with the period during which Epstein's trafficking activity has been documented through other sources. Note: the CBP gap is a systemic issue predating Epstein's relationship with Sultan (which began in 2009) and is not connected to DP World.

### Tom Barrack as UAE Intermediary
Tom Barrack, who served as an intermediary between Epstein, Sultan, and Dubai interests, was indicted in 2021 on charges of acting as an unregistered foreign agent for the UAE but was acquitted on all counts in November 2022. His documented role as a go-between for US and Gulf interests is established in the email record regardless of the trial outcome.

### Financial Relationship
The $6,200 payment from Epstein to Sultan documents a direct financial relationship. The purpose of this payment (reimbursement, gift, or other) is not specified in the records.

### The Jan 2019 Meeting
A gathering five months before arrest involving the world's largest port operator CEO, a former White House Chief Strategist, and multiple international figures is documented in the email record. The purpose of the meeting is not stated in the available documents.

### Bannon Phone Evidence
SDNY prosecutors discovered Epstein-Bannon text messages on Bannon's seized iPhone 7 ([EFTA00027290](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00027290.pdf)) and a photo of Trump with Ghislaine Maxwell on the same phone ([EFTA00025553](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00025553.pdf)/[EFTA00030999](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00030999.pdf)). The texts were deemed "not responsive to our warrant" -- meaning they were discovered during the We Build the Wall investigation but apparently not pursued in the Epstein context.

## 9.2 Unanswered Questions

1. **What was the Port of St. Croix discussion about?** Did DP World actually pursue any port concession or service agreement in St. Croix? What role did Epstein/Kellerhals play?

2. **What are the full contents of the Bannon-Epstein text messages** on Bannon's iPhone 7?

3. **Who are "3BIS"** who wanted to come to the island for Feb 2-5, 2019?

4. **What happened at the Jan-Feb 2019 Paris/Island meetings?** Did they actually occur?

5. **What is on the "LSJ XMAS/Sultan" CD-R?** The image analysis shows photographs from Little St. James with faces redacted.

6. **What was Amar Siad's role at Emirates?** Was airline access used to facilitate movement of models/victims?

7. **Did the 23andMe kit actually reach Sheikh Mohammed?** What was the purpose of genetic testing Gulf rulers?

8. **What was Sultan's role in the Dec 2010 "Re: Jeffrey Epstein" email chain** that involved multiple parties and spanned several pages?

9. **What was the "Hall of Fame" nomination** for Sultan, involving Mohammed Sharaf and Anil Wats? Was this a legitimate honor or a leverage mechanism?

10. **What was the "coverage" subject** in [EFTA01876026](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01876026.pdf) that included Sultan, Mohammed Sharaf, and Mohammed Al Muallem (all DP World executives)?

# CONCLUSION

The Sultan bin Sulayem / DP World connection to Jeffrey Epstein, documented across over 5,000 records in the DOJ files, represents one of Epstein's most extensive documented business relationships. It is not a casual social connection but a decade-long arrangement in which Epstein served as a geopolitical consultant to DP World, involving:

1. **Port strategy consulting across at least seven countries/regions** -- Cuba, Venezuela, UK (London Gateway), Congo, Gabon, USVI (St. Croix), and Senegal
2. **The St. Croix port discussion** -- originated by Epstein in September 2014, with detailed specifications provided by his USVI attorney, and ongoing through at least June 2016
3. **Brokered introductions** to Lord Mandelson (UK Secretary of State), Ehud Barak (former Israeli PM), Tom Pritzker (Hyatt Hotels), and Joi Ito (MIT Media Lab)
4. **Access to two tiers of Dubai royalty** -- Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum (ruler) and Crown Prince Sheikh Hamdan, including 30 DNA ancestry kits shipped to the Al Maktoum family
5. **Qatar royal connections** via Jabor Al Thani, who held governmental authority to issue landing permits for Epstein's aircraft at Doha
6. **Financial payments** documented in Deutsche Bank records
7. **Island architecture facilitated** through Creative Kingdom (Dubai), progressing to formal USVI permit applications
8. **Physical photographic evidence** of Sultan at Epstein's island
9. **Identification by a victim/witness** in testimony
10. **Bill Richardson offered as intermediary** -- connecting a documented trafficking co-conspirator to DP World's Cuba/Venezuela port ambitions
11. **Introduction of Epstein to heads of state** -- Sultan told President Kabila of the DRC that Epstein was "an American fund manager" who would visit for mining/oil investments

When combined with Tom Barrack's documented intermediary role between US and Gulf interests (he was indicted but acquitted on foreign agent charges in 2022), Bannon's role as political intelligence broker, Daniel Siad's recruitment operation migrating to Dubai, the Emirates airline connection through Amar Siad, and Epstein's documented CBP/customs issues and records gaps, the documentary record describes an intersection of global port operations, political influence networks, and Epstein's other documented activities.
