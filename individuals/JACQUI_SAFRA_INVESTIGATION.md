# EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Jacob "Jacqui" Eli Safra (b. 1947), Swiss billionaire investor and member of the Safra banking dynasty, maintained a documented relationship with Jeffrey Epstein mediated primarily through literary agent **John Brockman** and the **Edge Foundation** dinner circuit. The EFTA corpus contains **100+ documents** referencing Safra or the Safra family, including direct email exchanges, property sale negotiations, financial opportunity discussions, and dozens of Edge Foundation event guest lists where both Safra and Epstein were attendees.

Key findings:

1. **Brockman actively pitched Safra's Jerusalem property to Epstein** — "The Sherover House" in the Talbieh neighborhood ([EFTA00394883](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00394883.pdf), Feb 2013). Epstein and Safra discussed the property at a March 2014 dinner, and Epstein responded to Lesley Groff's follow-up with "yes, and Paul Allen" ([EFTA01933564](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01933564.pdf)).
2. **Brockman proposed Safra's financial difficulties as a business opportunity for Epstein** — "his loan at one of the big banks is not getting renewed. Something for you??" Epstein replied: "im always in. whatever you need." ([EFTA00749227](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00749227.pdf), June 2010)
3. **Epstein sought to acquire Safra's assets** — "get me a list of safras interesting things for sale" ([EFTA00687462](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00687462.pdf), Oct 2011)
4. **Both appeared on dozens of Edge Foundation "Billionaires' Dinner" guest lists** alongside Bezos, Page, Brin, Zuckerberg, Thiel, and other tech executives (2009-2015+).
5. **Epstein also expressed distrust of the broader Safra family** — "note I would not do biz with the safras, under any circumstances. though I have had many opportunities" ([EFTA02468988](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02468988.pdf)). This appears to distinguish between his personal relationship with Jacqui (via Brockman) and broader Safra family business dealings.
6. **No sexual allegations, no victim testimony, and no trafficking-related documents** connect Jacqui Safra to any criminal activity. His documented role is as a member of Epstein's elite social/financial network accessed through the Brockman/Edge Foundation pipeline.

# PART II: THE JERUSALEM PROPERTY EMAILS — IDENTIFICATION ESTABLISHED

## Document 1: [EFTA00394883](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00394883.pdf) — Brockman Pitches Sherover House to Epstein (Feb 26, 2013)

**Source:** full_text_corpus.db (DS9)
**Significance:** CRITICAL — Establishes Jacqui Safra's identity, the Jerusalem property, and Brockman as intermediary

Full text (from OCR):
> "Westin Rm 1522 JE, YOUR HOUSE IN JERUSALEM -- Jacqui Safra is here with me. Wants to sell you his Jerusalem house in Talbieh neighborhood known as 'The Sherover House' across st from Jerusalem Theatre (that the Sherovers built and donated to city)"

**Analysis:** John Brockman, staying at the Westin hotel (likely during a conference), writes to Epstein ("JE") with a real estate pitch. The subject line "YOUR HOUSE IN JERUSALEM" suggests Epstein had previously expressed interest in Jerusalem property. Brockman identifies the property specifically: "The Sherover House" in the **Talbieh** neighborhood, across from the **Jerusalem Theatre** — all details that match Jacqui Safra's known real estate holdings. The Jerusalem Theatre (also known as the Sherover Theatre) was built and donated to the city by the Sherover family, whose property Safra acquired.

## Document 2: [EFTA01750543](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01750543.pdf) — Groff Follow-Up (March 24, 2014)

**Source:** full_text_corpus.db (DS10)
**Date:** Monday, March 24, 2014, 11:36:09 AM

Full text:
> **From:** Lesley Groff
> **To:** Jeffrey Epstein (jeevacation@mail.com)
> **Subject:** Reminder: John Brockman/Jacqui
>
> "Reminder: did you want to set up a call with Jacqui?"
>
> **Forwarded message from John Brockman (March 20, 2014, 4:24:20 PM EDT):**
> **To:** Jeffrey Epstein (jeevacation@gmail.com)
> **Cc:** Lesley Groff
> **Subject:** Jacqui's Jerusalem residence
>
> "JE, Jacqui wants to know if you would like to have a serious conversation about his Jerusalem residence that he discussed with you Monday night. If so: **Jacqui Safra** [phone number]. JB — John Brockman"

**Analysis:** This is the document previously cited in the Israel intelligence reports with the analysis "The identity of 'Jacqui' is not established in the documents." **That assessment was incorrect.** The full text of this very document explicitly names **"Jacqui Safra"** and provides his phone number. The earlier analysis relied only on fragmentary OCR from the redaction-layer scan, which captured only the subject line and timestamps. The full body text — available in full_text_corpus.db — contains the complete identification.

Brockman's email references something "discussed with you Monday night" — this was the March 17, 2014 **Edge Foundation "Billionaires' Dinner"** held at the Blue Water Cafe in Vancouver, where both Safra and Epstein were confirmed attendees alongside Jeff Bezos, Larry Page, Sergey Brin, and Paul Allen.

## Document 3: [EFTA01933564](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01933564.pdf) — Epstein's Reply (March 24, 2014)

**Source:** full_text_corpus.db (DS10)
**Date:** Monday, March 24, 2014, 12:14:25 PM

Full text:
> **From:** [Epstein]
> **Subject:** Re: Reminder: John Brockman/Jacqui
>
> "yes, and Paul Allen,"

**Analysis:** Epstein confirms he wants the call set up with Jacqui Safra. The addition of "and Paul Allen" indicates Epstein wanted simultaneous outreach to Paul Allen (Microsoft co-founder, d. 2018) — potentially as a co-investor or competing buyer for the Jerusalem property. This is consistent with the March 17 dinner where Allen was also present.

## Document 4: [EFTA00372329](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00372329.pdf) / [EFTA00986212](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00986212.pdf) — Groff Arranges the Call (March 24, 2014)

**Source:** full_text_corpus.db (DS9, duplicate pair)

> **From:** Lesley Groff

> **Subject:** Jacqui Safra
>
> "Please see below..I asked him to confirm this is EST or what time zone, but he has not responded as of yet...the number Brockman gave us for Jacqui is: [phone number]"

## Document 5: [EFTA00372330](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00372330.pdf) / [EFTA00986215](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00986215.pdf) — Safra Confirms Availability

**Source:** full_text_corpus.db (DS9, duplicate pair)

> **From:** j e safra
> **Subject:** Re: Jeffrey Epstein
>
> "yes, i am in ny — J"

**Analysis:** Direct email from Jacqui Safra ("j e safra") confirming his location in New York and availability for a call with Epstein. The lowercase, terse style is consistent with a mobile reply.

## Document 6: [EFTA00372331](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00372331.pdf) — Groff Confirms

# PART III: FINANCIAL OPPORTUNITY — BROCKMAN AS BROKER

## Document 7: [EFTA00749227](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00749227.pdf) — Safra's Banking Difficulty (June 16, 2010)

**Source:** full_text_corpus.db (DS9)
**Duplicate:** [EFTA02413047](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02413047.pdf), [EFTA00735612](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00735612.pdf), [EFTA00893568](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00893568.pdf)

> **From:** John Brockman
> **To:** Jeffrey Epstein
> **Subject:** Jacqui Safra
>
> "JE, Had dinner with Jacqui last night, whose is in town scrambling because his loan at one of the big banks is not getting renewed. Something for you??"

Epstein replied:
> "im always in. whatever you need."

**Analysis:** Brockman pitches Safra's financial difficulty — a major bank declining to renew a loan — as a potential investment or lending opportunity for Epstein. This was June 2010, less than one year after Epstein's release from his Florida prison sentence (July 22, 2009). Epstein's eager reply ("im always in") suggests he viewed Safra as a valuable financial target. The date is notable: Epstein was still rebuilding his financial network post-conviction, and access to a ~$5 billion Safra banking dynasty member represented significant opportunity.

## Document 8: [EFTA00687462](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00687462.pdf) — Epstein Seeks Safra Assets (Oct 26, 2011)

**Source:** full_text_corpus.db (DS9)
**Duplicate:** [EFTA00922944](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00922944.pdf)

> **From:** Epstein
> **To:** John Brockman
>
> "get me a list of safras interesting things for sale"

**Analysis:** Epstein proactively requests Brockman compile an inventory of Safra's available assets. Given Safra's known holdings in Old Masters art ($87M+ collection), Encyclopaedia Britannica, Spring Mountain Vineyards, and Jerusalem real estate, the scope of "interesting things for sale" could be substantial. This positions Brockman as an active broker between the two, not merely a social introducer.

# PART IV: EDGE FOUNDATION DINNER CIRCUIT

Jacqui Safra appears on **dozens** of Edge Foundation event guest lists alongside Jeffrey Epstein. These dinners, organized by John Brockman, were the primary social environment connecting the two. Below is a selection of documented appearances:

## Event Guest Lists

| Date/Event | EFTA Number(s) | Other Notable Attendees |

| Vancouver "Billionaires' Dinner" (March 17, 2014) | Per Edge.org public records | Jeff Bezos, Larry Page, Sergey Brin, Paul Allen |

**Profile from Event Bios:**
[EFTA00649356](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00649356.pdf) lists Safra as: "J.E. (Jacqui) Safra, Investor, Art Collector; Encyclopaedia Britannica, Spring Mountain Vineyards"

## Safra's Napa Vineyard as Gathering Venue

[EFTA00385244](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00385244.pdf) / [EFTA00967605](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00967605.pdf) — Brockman to Epstein (Aug 21, 2013):
> "On vacation in Napa (at Safra's place) with Kahneman and Thaler."

[EFTA00757793](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00757793.pdf):
> "Stewart Brand, Danny and I spent some time at Jacqui Safra's Spring Mountain Vineyard in St. Helena"

[EFTA00733901](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00733901.pdf) — Peggy Siegal:
> "Jaqui Safra gave us $10,000 worth of wine from his own Napa Valley vineyard...kids drinking $100 bottles of wine"

**Analysis:** Safra's Napa vineyard served as a secondary gathering venue for the Brockman/Edge social network. Nobel laureate Daniel Kahneman, economist Richard Thaler, and technology futurist Stewart Brand all visited the property in contexts reported back to Epstein.

# PART V: THE PEGGY SIEGAL SOCIAL ORBIT

Peggy Siegal — celebrity publicist and longtime Epstein associate (150+ documents in the corpus) — was part of the Safra/Doumanian social circle, traveling on Safra's private aircraft and socializing extensively:

| Date | EFTA Number(s) | Content |
|------|----------------|---------|
| July 2009 | [EFTA00737951](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00737951.pdf), [EFTA00737960](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00737960.pdf), [EFTA00737963](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00737963.pdf) | "Jaqui Safra, Jean Doumanian and I left Portofino this morning — drove to Genoa and flew into Famborough....now driving to London." |
| July 2009 | [EFTA02439943](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02439943.pdf) | "I just got off the phone with Jean Doumainian, Jackie Safra's girlfriend. Jean and I are flying on Jackie's plane Thursday, July 16th to pick Jackie up in Geneva and go on to Portofino for the weekend." |
| Undated | [EFTA00773000](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00773000.pdf) | "Last Thursday Jaqui Safra (of European banking dynasty) sent the G4 for his girlfriend of 30 years and a theater producer, Jean Doumanian and me. Huge plane — two beds — two people. Not bad. We picked him up in Geneva." |
| Undated | [EFTA02430386](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02430386.pdf) | Siegal to someone: "Jean Doumanian — Broadway producer and Jaqui Safra — banker I introduced you to for drinks when we came thru London after Portifino mid July." |

**Note:** Jean Doumanian, Safra's partner of 35+ years, appears in the Epstein corpus in contact/social lists paired with Safra (e.g., "J.E. Safra/Doumanian" in [EFTA00719772](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00719772.pdf), [EFTA00738932](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00738932.pdf), [EFTA00740586](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00740586.pdf), [EFTA00877601](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00877601.pdf)).

# PART VI: THE "I WOULD NOT DO BIZ WITH THE SAFRAS" EMAIL

## Document: [EFTA02468988](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02468988.pdf)

**Source:** full_text_corpus.db (DS11)

> "note I would not do biz with the safras, under any circumstances. though I have had many opportunities. if she wanted to sell to them I would not participate."

**Analysis:** This email contains Epstein's most direct statement about the Safra family — a categorical refusal to do business with them. The context ("if she wanted to sell to them I would not participate") suggests a discussion about a third party's transaction where the Safras were potential counterparties. The plural "the safras" and the emphatic "under any circumstances" distinguish this from his personal relationship with Jacqui specifically (whom he was willing to take a call from, discuss property with, and consider lending to).

This duality — personal social relationship via Brockman while refusing broader family business dealings — is consistent with Epstein's pattern of maintaining elite social access while strategically managing his financial exposure. It may also reflect awareness of compliance risks associated with the Safra banking dynasty, which faced multiple regulatory actions (including Edmond Safra's Republic National Bank involvement in Russian money laundering allegations in the late 1990s).

---

# PART VII: OTHER SAFRA FAMILY REFERENCES IN CORPUS

The corpus contains references to other members of the Safra family, distinct from Jacqui:

| Person | Relationship | Key EFTA | Context |
|--------|-------------|----------|---------|
| **Edmond Safra** (d. 1999) | Jacqui's uncle | [EFTA00718519](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00718519.pdf) | "philanthropist Lily Safra, widow of banking mogul Edmond Safra" — invitation to Epstein for event |
| **Lily Safra** | Edmond's widow | [EFTA00718519](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00718519.pdf) | Invitation for Epstein to attend philanthropic event |
| **Andrew Safra** | Separate branch | [EFTA00743248](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00743248.pdf), [EFTA00766561](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00766561.pdf) | Film premiere rival to Peggy Siegal; Epstein to Sarah Ferguson: "andrew safra is doing your new york prmeir for young victoria, why not peggy siegal that loves you?" |
| **Steven Russell Safra** | Unrelated (same surname) | [EFTA00601154](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00601154.pdf), 100+ legal filings | Attorney at Cole, Scott & Kissane representing **Alan Dershowitz** in Epstein-related litigation |
| **Safra Bank** | Banking institution | [EFTA00094977](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00094977.pdf) | Complaint referencing "Safra Bank" and an Israeli employee named "Sigi" |
| **Joseph Safra** | Cousin branch | [EFTA00711362](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00711362.pdf) | Forbes list: "Brazilian banker Joseph Safra at 52 with $13.8 billion" |
| **Safra Catz** | Unrelated (first name) | [EFTA00774855](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00774855.pdf), [EFTA00259527](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00259527.pdf) | Oracle CEO, considered for national security position |

Additionally, documents reference a "Safra (150-200) member list" in the context of real estate marketing ([EFTA01055463](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01055463.pdf), [EFTA01055465](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01055465.pdf)):
> "david also spoke about obtaining safra (150-200) member list and will market directly to them. david said they will market together and he will donate 100,000 for each purchase from that list to Safra"

And a paternity suit reference: **Deborah Safra** sued Scott Rothstein for paternity in 1994 ([EFTA00768865](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00768865.pdf)).

---

# PART VIII: WHAT THE DOCUMENTS DO NOT SHOW

**No sexual allegations:** Zero victim testimony, FBI notes, NTOC tips, or prosecution documents connect Jacqui Safra to any sexual misconduct.

**No trafficking connections:** Safra does not appear in any documents related to MC2 Model Management, massage scheduling, victim recruitment, or transportation of minors.

**No financial entanglement with Epstein entities:** Safra does not appear in Deutsche Bank records, RM CODE 82289 entity lists, wire transfer logs, or SAR filings associated with Epstein's shell company network.

**No intelligence connections:** Unlike other Israel-connected figures in the corpus (Barak, Shabtai, Kohn), Safra has no documented connection to intelligence services, military activity, or geopolitical operations.

**The Jerusalem property sale appears not to have been completed.** No subsequent documents in the corpus reference a closing, wire transfer, or property acquisition in Jerusalem by Epstein. Epstein's known properties at the time of his death (Manhattan townhouse, Palm Beach mansion, Zorro Ranch NM, two US Virgin Islands, Paris apartment) did not include Jerusalem real estate.

---

# PART IX: ASSESSMENT

**Relationship Type:** Social/financial network member, accessed through Brockman/Edge Foundation pipeline
**Relationship Duration:** At least June 2010 to March 2014 (direct documented contact); Edge Foundation overlap may extend further in both directions
**Primary Intermediary:** John Brockman (all known direct Safra-Epstein contact was initiated or facilitated by Brockman)
**Evidence Grade:** LOW — Social network member with no criminal nexus documented

Jacqui Safra's role in the Epstein files is that of a **high-net-worth social contact** — one of dozens of billionaires in the Edge Foundation orbit whom Epstein cultivated through Brockman. The relationship involved:
- Real estate discussions (Jerusalem property)
- Financial opportunity discussions (Safra's loan difficulty)
- Asset acquisition interest (Epstein seeking Safra's "interesting things for sale")
- Shared social events (Edge dinners, Brockman circuit)

This is substantively different from figures like Ehud Barak (25+ direct emails, apartment in Epstein's building), Leon Black ($158M in documented payments), or Nicole Junkermann (island visit, 11-year advisory relationship). Safra's contact was mediated entirely through Brockman and centered on conventional financial/social networking.
