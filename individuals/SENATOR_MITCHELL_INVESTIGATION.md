## 3. SOURCE 1: VICTIM ACCUSATION COMPILATION

**Document:** [EFTA00022133](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00022133.pdf), Page 5
**Database:** OCR (OCR text extraction database), Image Analysis (image catalog database)
**Type:** 9-page research compilation of victim accusations from press reporting, hearing transcripts, and Boies Schiller lawsuits

### Exact Text ([EFTA00022133](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00022133.pdf), p.5):

> MBB also alleges Epstein and Maxwell told her to have sex with former New Mexico governor Bill Richardson; **former Democratic Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell**; the late MIT computer scientist Marvin Minsky; and MC2 model agency cofounder Jean Luc Brunel, as well as an unnamed "prince," "foreign president," and owner of "a French hotel chain." [REDACTED] previously alleged she had been forced by Epstein and Maxwell to have sex with lawyer Alan Dershowitz and Britain's Prince Andrew.

### Analysis:

- The victim identified as "MBB" is Virginia Roberts Giuffre, based on the pattern of allegations matching her public statements and sworn depositions
- Mitchell is named alongside Richardson, Minsky, Brunel, Dershowitz, and Prince Andrew -- all individuals who appear in multiple other Epstein documents
- The allegation is that **Epstein and Maxwell directed** the victim to have sexual contact with Mitchell
- This is sourced from hearing transcript testimony and the Boies Schiller lawsuit filings
- Giuffre separately stated: "My body was put on the banquet menu... for a powerful senator, George Mitchell" (per Philadelphia Inquirer reporting, August 2019)

### Corroborating Context from Same Document:

The compilation documents 30+ victims across 9 pages. Mitchell appears only in connection with the Giuffre allegations. Other victims in the same compilation do not independently name Mitchell. The document compiles accusations from:
- Press reporting (New York Post, Miami Herald, New York Times)
- Hearing transcripts (Brad Edwards, Gloria Allred victim statements)
- Boies Schiller Flexner lawsuit filings
- Court documents

## 4. SOURCE 2: VICTIM JOURNAL

**Document:** [EFTA02731420](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2012/EFTA02731420.pdf), Page 12
**Database:** OCR (OCR text extraction database)
**Classification:** CONFIDENTIAL FOR ATTORNEY'S EYES ONLY -- DO NOT COPY

### Full Text of Relevant Page ([EFTA02731420](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2012/EFTA02731420.pdf), p.12):

> CONFIDENTIAL FOR ATTORNEY'S EYES ONLY
> DO NOT COPY
>
> They are always flights of horror.
>
> Whether its with Jeffrey, Mr. Leonsis, Mr. Case, Mr. Snyder, the Gregorys, Mr. Colgan or one being borrowed by a seemingly "good" federal worker and even rented,
>
> it is all horror.
> And nothing is as it seems
>
> I am so confused by everything and people you expect to be good like **even old senators like George Mitchell who you think would be good like a grandpa are bad.**
>
> Mr. Kimsey is deranged,
> The answer is c. crazy!
>
> It all is!
>
> CONFIDENTIAL

### Analysis:

1. **Source Identity:** This is from a victim journal ([EFTA02731420](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2012/EFTA02731420.pdf), 13 pages total) that names over 20 individuals across its pages, including Leon Black, Larry Summers, Dan Snyder, Ted Leonsis, Steve Case, Jim Kimsey, Larry Summers, Prince Andrew, and others.

2. **Context of Mitchell Reference:** Mitchell is named in the specific context of:
   - "Flights of horror" -- placing him in the context of Epstein's aviation network
   - "People you expect to be good" -- suggesting Mitchell presented a trustworthy, grandfatherly persona
   - "like a grandpa are bad" -- the victim expected Mitchell to be safe but was not
   - The word "bad" in this journal's context carries implications of sexual abuse, given the surrounding content

3. **Other Names on Same Page:**
   - Mr. Leonsis (Ted Leonsis, AOL executive -- separately accused of filming abuse in second journal)
   - Mr. Case (Steve Case, AOL founder)
   - Mr. Snyder (Dan Snyder, Washington football team owner)
   - The Gregorys (unidentified couple)
   - Mr. Colgan (unidentified)
   - Mr. Kimsey (Jim Kimsey, AOL co-founder -- described as "deranged")

4. **Flight Connection:** The entry begins with "They are always flights of horror," placing Mitchell within the framework of Epstein's air travel network. The victim describes horror on flights "with Jeffrey" and others, suggesting Mitchell was encountered during air travel or at destinations reached by air.

5. **Independence from Giuffre:** This journal appears to be from a **different victim** than Virginia Giuffre, based on the writing style, references to individuals (Leonsis, Case, Kimsey), and the nature of the entries. This means Mitchell was named by **at least two independent victims**.

### Critical Findings:

1. **Groff Called the US State Department:** Epstein's personal assistant, who was later identified as a co-conspirator in the NPA and invoked her Fifth Amendment privilege during the SDNY investigation, **called the United States State Department** looking for Senator Mitchell. This demonstrates:
   - A level of access and familiarity where calling government agencies on Epstein's behalf was routine
   - The relationship was significant enough to warrant tracking Mitchell across institutions

2. **Timeline Match:** Mitchell resigned as Special Envoy to the Middle East in May 2011. This July 2012 email shows Groff was unaware Mitchell had already left the State Department over a year earlier, suggesting intermittent but persistent contact.

3. **Ann Ungar Identified:** Mitchell's assistant at DLA Piper is named as Ann Ungar. Groff had her number and instructed others to "please make note" -- indicating ongoing contact management.

4. **"Tea or get together":** The invitation suggests a personal social relationship, not a formal political or business meeting.

5. **Post-Conviction Contact:** This email is from July 2012 -- **four years after Epstein's 2008 Florida conviction** for solicitation of prostitution involving a minor. Mitchell's willingness to maintain social contact post-conviction is significant.

6. **DS9 Dual Production:** This email also appears in DS9 as [EFTA00408507](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00408507.pdf), confirming it was produced twice across datasets.

7. **Mitchell Proactively Called (DS9 -- NEW):** The next day, July 25, 2012, [EFTA00408367](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00408367.pdf) records: "Senator Mitchell called to let you know he is spending the summer in Maine. He is chairing a conference today and tomorrow but says if you would like to catch up to give him a call this Friday or Saturday on his cell." Mitchell proactively called Groff (not merely returning a call), offered his personal cell for weekend contact, and explicitly invited Epstein to "catch up." This directly contradicts his spokesperson's claim that he "declined or deflected invitations."

8. **Same Day Activity:** This email was sent the same day as [EFTA01766832](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01766832.pdf) (a Joe Pagano call list at 5:28 PM). Groff was managing multiple high-priority contacts for Epstein simultaneously, suggesting Mitchell was part of regular contact rotation.

## 6. SOURCE 4: MAGAZINE PROFILE

**Document:** [EFTA00013640](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00013640.pdf)
**Database:** OCR (OCR text extraction database), Image Analysis (image catalog database)
**Type:** Magazine feature article (appears to be Vanity Fair or similar publication, circa early 2000s)

### Relevant Passage:

> Epstein brings a trophy-hunter's zeal to his collection of scientists and politicians. But the real charge for him is in seeing these guys work it. Like former Democratic Senate leader **George Mitchell**, for example. In Epstein's mind, Mitchell is the world's greatest negotiator, based on his work in Ireland and the Middle East. **So he wrote the senator a bunch of checks.** Says Mitchell: **"He has supported some philanthropic projects of mine and organized a fund-raiser for me once. I would certainly call him a friend and a supporter."**

### Analysis:

1. **Financial Relationship Confirmed:** Epstein "wrote the senator a bunch of checks." This establishes a direct financial connection -- Epstein donated to Mitchell's philanthropic projects and organized a fundraiser.

2. **Mitchell's Own Words:** Mitchell himself acknowledged the relationship: "I would certainly call him a friend and a supporter." This is a direct, on-the-record admission of friendship, not merely a passing acquaintance.

3. **Epstein's Admiration:** Epstein viewed Mitchell as "the world's greatest negotiator" based on his Ireland and Middle East work. This places Mitchell within Epstein's pattern of collecting political and intellectual elite.

4. **Trophy Hunting Pattern:** The article explicitly describes Epstein's approach as bringing "a trophy-hunter's zeal to his collection of scientists and politicians." Mitchell is presented as a prime example of this pattern.

5. **Context:** In the same article, Epstein's relationship with Bill Clinton is described in detail, including the Africa trip on the Boeing 727. Mitchell is presented alongside Clinton as part of Epstein's political network.

## 7. SOURCE 5: FBI DOCUMENT -- MULTI-DAY TRIP ALLEGATION

**Source:** Reporting by Bangor Daily News (February 2, 2026) citing newly released FBI documents from the DOJ file release of 3+ million pages.

### Key Allegation:

An FBI document describes a woman alleging that Epstein sent her for **"multiday trips"** with Mitchell in **California and Washington, D.C.**, between **2003-2004**.

### Significance:

1. **Specific Locations:** California and Washington, D.C. -- not Epstein's typical New York/Palm Beach/USVI locations. This suggests Mitchell-specific travel arrangements.

2. **Multi-Day Duration:** "Multiday trips" implies extended stays, not brief encounters.

3. **2003-2004 Timeframe:** This predates Epstein's 2005 Palm Beach investigation and 2008 plea deal. Mitchell would have been approximately 70-71 years old.

4. **FBI Documentation:** This allegation was documented in FBI investigative files. Note that the FBI records all allegations received during an investigation; inclusion in the files does not itself indicate a credibility assessment.

**Note:** This specific FBI document was not directly identified in the four databases searched. It may be in documents that were not OCR-processed or in redacted portions that were not recovered. The allegation is documented through press reporting of the DOJ file release.

### FBI Photo Identification Procedure (DS9 -- NEW)

[EFTA00162974](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00162974.pdf) (DS9): NBC producer Sarah Fitzpatrick's urgent request to FBI (September 19, 2019) references a victim interview in which: "She says that as part of the interview she told the FBI the names of the men she was directed to have sex with, and was given photos of prominent men in Epstein's orbit to help her identify." The victim identified Mitchell through this **photo identification procedure**, not merely verbal description. The same document contains the claim that FBI Agent Jason Richards told the victim in 2014 that "his head had been cut off above him" and that he was "instructed to stop investigating the Epstein case."

### NTOC Flight Record Tip (DS9 -- NEW)

[EFTA00277082](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00277082.pdf) (DS9): A tip states: "Allegedly Maine US Senator George Mitchell is, and he was, according to published flight records, on Epstein's plane." This does not prove the claim, but it documents that the allegation was circulating with a claimed evidentiary basis. The original report's finding that Mitchell does not appear in digitized flight logs remains accurate.

---

## 8. SOURCE 6: POST-CONVICTION CONTACT (2010-2018)

**UPDATE (DS9 Revisit):** The original report relied primarily on press reporting for most post-conviction contact evidence. DS9 contains the actual source emails -- at least 20 distinct email documents spanning September 2011 through September 2015, demonstrating sustained, active, reciprocal contact between Mitchell and Epstein's office.

### September 2011: Confirmed Meeting + Jes Staley Introduction Attempt

[EFTA00428638](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00428638.pdf) (Sept 10, 2011): Groff to "Julia, Janice and Maher": "Jeffrey Epstein is in New York this weekend and was wondering if senator Mitchell might be as well. Jeffrey would love to see him tomorrow, Sunday sept 11th."

[EFTA00428166](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00428166.pdf) (Sept 12, 2011): "Senator Mitchell will come more about 4:15...he says he must leave at 10 or 5 minutes to 5:00" -- **confirmed meeting at Epstein's residence**.

[EFTA00427635](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00427635.pdf) (Sept 20, 2011): "Senator Mitchell is in London now and not coming back to NY until Saturday. He says he would like to meet Jes at another time...Senator Mitchell sends his best." Epstein was attempting to introduce Mitchell to Barclays CEO Jes Staley. Staley was later listed alongside Glenn Dubin in an internal prosecution planning document ([EFTA00098755](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00098755.pdf)) under "Individuals Who Have Engaged in Massages with Epstein Girls."

### ~2010: Yom Kippur Break-Fast Dinner

[EFTA00298379](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00298379.pdf)-[EFTA00298383](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00298383.pdf): Complete guest list for Epstein's Yom Kippur break-fast dinner at 9 East 71st Street. Confirmed attendees included Eva & Glenn Dubin, Alan Dershowitz, Leon Black, Jes & Debra Staley, Marvin & Gloria Minsky, Jean Luc Brunel, and others. Mitchell was listed as **declined**.

The planning notes reveal Mitchell's strategic value to Epstein: "Je said if senator Mitchell confirms, then invite Larry Summers and Ehud Barak and tell them both that senator Mitchell will be coming." Mitchell was being used as a **social draw** -- Epstein planned to leverage a Mitchell confirmation to attract Summers and Barak.

### July 2012: Mitchell Proactively Calls + State Department Email

[EFTA00408507](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00408507.pdf) (Jul 24, 2012): The State Department email (also in DS11 as [EFTA02522767](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02522767.pdf)).

[EFTA00408367](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00408367.pdf) (Jul 25, 2012): "Senator Mitchell called to let you know he is spending the summer in Maine. He is chairing a conference today and tomorrow but says if you would like to catch up to give him a call this Friday or Saturday on his cell." Mitchell proactively called Groff, offered his personal cell for weekend contact, and explicitly invited Epstein to "catch up."

### February-March 2013: Bill Gates Lunch Attempts

[EFTA00395729](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00395729.pdf) (Feb 13, 2013): "Senator Mitchell appreciates your kind invitation to possibly have lunch with you and [redacted] on March 1, but he has a once a year meeting in Ft. Myers, FL for the Board of Directors for the Red Sox."

[EFTA00953696](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00953696.pdf) (Feb 13, 2013): **Unredacted version** confirms the lunch was with "you and **Bill Gates**."

[EFTA00395024](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00395024.pdf) (Feb 23, 2013): Second attempt: "LM for Senator Mitchell asking if he might be available to meet with you and Bill Gate late Wed. Feb. 27th evening."

[EFTA00395031](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00395031.pdf) (Feb 23, 2013): Mitchell declines second attempt: "Senator Mitchell has a busy week of traveling... He hopes you are doing well."

[EFTA00395264](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00395264.pdf): Calendar entry: "TBD Possible Lunch w/Bill Gates (maybe Senator Mitchell?)" -- March 1, 2013.

### November 2013: Scheduled Appointment in New York

[EFTA00284786](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00284786.pdf): Calendar confirms appointment with Mitchell at 10:30 AM, November 6, 2013 in New York.

### September 2015: Direct Email Reply (NEW -- Extends Timeline by 2 Years)

[EFTA00339490](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00339490.pdf) (Sept 22, 2015): Epstein directs Groff: "as senator mitchell if he woudl like to have a coffee with terje and ehud this week. or chomsly onver the weekend."

[EFTA00339499](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00339499.pdf) (Sept 22, 2015): Groff to Mitchell: "Jeffrey is asking if you would like to have coffee with Terje Rod Larsen and Ehud Barak next week... or with Noam Chomsky Sat. Oct 3 or 4...Might you be in NY coming up and available?"

[EFTA00339592](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00339592.pdf) (Sept 23, 2015): **Mitchell's direct reply** (From: "Mitchell, George"): "Thanks but I'm traveling for most of the next couple of weeks, in Houston tonight then Aspen for 4 days, then Maine and DC parts of next week. I think I will see Ehud Barak at a conference in Aspen and in NY where I'll be for a 1 day conference where we're both speaking. **Best regards to Jeffrey and to you.**"

[EFTA00339594](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00339594.pdf) (Sept 23, 2015): Groff to Mitchell: "Wow! What a schedule! Thank you for letting me know and I will pass along to Jeffrey. Hopefully next time we can put something together."

This is September 2015 -- seven years post-conviction. Mitchell replies directly to Epstein's office, shares his travel schedule, sends "Best regards to Jeffrey," and notes he will independently see Barak. This extends the documented relationship **two years beyond** the original report's latest confirmed contact (Nov 2013).

### December 2018: iMessage from Epstein

[EFTA00508979](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00508979.pdf), page 9 (Dec 20, 2018): iMessage chain during government shutdown: Epstein writes "Sen George Mitchell a very close friend when senate majority leader. Said a budget deal is never done earlier than 11 55 pm on the eve of a shutdown." This is the actual source document (device extraction) for the iMessage previously cited through press reporting.

### Mitchell's Response to Post-Conviction Contact:

Mitchell's spokesperson stated: "Senator Mitchell declined or deflected invitations from Epstein that came afterward."

**Assessment:** The documentary evidence comprehensively contradicts this claim. DS9 documents show Mitchell proactively called Groff (July 2012), confirmed in-person meetings (September 2011), sent direct email replies with personal travel schedules (September 2015), expressed interest in meeting Epstein's associates (Staley introduction), and sent "Best regards to Jeffrey" seven years after conviction. Mitchell may have declined some specific invitations (Yom Kippur dinner, Gates lunches) but maintained warm, reciprocal contact throughout.

## 9. DISTINGUISHING GEORGE MITCHELL FROM DAVID MITCHELL

This investigation identified **two entirely separate individuals named Mitchell** in the Epstein files:

### Senator George Mitchell
- Former Senate Majority Leader
- Connection: political/social/philanthropic/alleged sexual
- Documents: [EFTA00022133](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00022133.pdf), [EFTA02731420](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2012/EFTA02731420.pdf), [EFTA02522767](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02522767.pdf), [EFTA00013640](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00013640.pdf), plus 20+ DS9 emails ([EFTA00339490](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00339490.pdf)-[EFTA00428663](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00428663.pdf))

- Mitchell's personal cell number in Epstein's master PEOPLE LIST (first name on the list)
- No Deutsche Bank payment records

### David J. Mitchell (Mitchell Holdings LLC)
- Financial/business associate
- Email: djm@mitchellholdings.com
- Addresses: 745 Fifth Avenue; 801 Madison Avenue, New York NY 10065
- Connection: property management, restaurant funding, "cascade" payments

- No sexual allegations

### Other Mitchells in Files (Not George)
- **Karen S. Mitchell** ([EFTA00027122](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00027122.pdf)) -- Court clerk, Northern District of Texas
- **Heather Mitchell** -- Appears in flight log knowledge graph (auto-created)
- **Andrew Mitchell** -- Appears in flight log knowledge graph (auto-created)
- **Mitchell, E.** ([EFTA00018300](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00018300.pdf)) -- Academic researcher (Goodman lab), child abuse disclosure studies
- **David Mitchell** ([EFTA00147306](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00147306.pdf)) -- Drug pricing testimony witness (unrelated)

---

## 10. FLIGHT LOGS AND TRAVEL EVIDENCE

### Direct Flight Log Evidence:

**Senator George Mitchell does NOT appear by name in the digitized flight log databases.** The knowledge graph contains entries for "Heather Mitchell" and "Andrew Mitchell" from flight logs, but no "George Mitchell."

### Indirect Travel Evidence:

1. **Victim Journal ([EFTA02731420](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2012/EFTA02731420.pdf)):** The page naming Mitchell begins with "They are always flights of horror," placing him in the context of Epstein's aviation network.

2. **FBI Document (per press reporting):** Alleges "multiday trips" to California and Washington, D.C. -- suggesting ground travel or commercial flights arranged by Epstein, not necessarily Epstein's private aircraft.

3. **Groff Email ([EFTA02522767](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02522767.pdf)):** Shows Epstein's office actively tracking Mitchell's location (New York vs. State Department) for potential meetups.

4. **Magazine Profile ([EFTA00013640](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00013640.pdf)):** Mitchell acknowledges Epstein "organized a fund-raiser for me once," implying in-person events.

5. **"People to See" Lists (DS9 -- NEW):** [EFTA00314269](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00314269.pdf)-[EFTA00314271](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00314271.pdf) (September 2011): Master weekly list includes "George Mitchell, Barnaby Marsh, Ehud Barak, Tom Pritzker, Sultan, President of Ivory Coast Ouattara, Boris Nikolic, Bill Richardson, Terje Roed Larsen, Abdullah, Hamad, Woody Allen, Brock Pierce, Jes Staley, Kissinger, Marvin [Minsky], Dr. Axel." Mitchell and Richardson -- the two named Democratic senators from the victim accusation compilation -- appear on the same week's schedule.

6. **Calendar Co-Occurrence (DS9 -- NEW):** Multiple DS9 calendar documents show Mitchell on the same weekly schedules as other named individuals: Richardson and Staley in September 2011 ([EFTA00428025](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00428025.pdf)); Barak/Chomsky in September 2015 ([EFTA00339490](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00339490.pdf)).

### Assessment:

The absence of Mitchell from digitized flight logs does not negate the allegations. Epstein operated multiple aircraft (Boeing 727, Gulfstream, Cessna 421, helicopter) and not all passengers were logged on all flights. Additionally, Mitchell may have been transported to Epstein via commercial means rather than private aircraft. An NTOC tip ([EFTA00277082](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00277082.pdf)) claims Mitchell was "on Epstein's plane" based on "published flight records," though this remains unverified.

---

## 11. FINANCIAL CONNECTIONS

### Direct Financial Flow: Epstein to Mitchell

1. **Philanthropic Donations:** Epstein "wrote the senator a bunch of checks" for Mitchell's philanthropic projects ([EFTA00013640](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00013640.pdf)).

2. **Fundraiser:** Epstein "organized a fund-raiser for me once" per Mitchell's own statement ([EFTA00013640](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00013640.pdf)).

3. **Quantum:** The amounts are not specified in the available documents. No Deutsche Bank wire records to Senator George Mitchell were identified. The "bunch of checks" may have been personal checks from Epstein or written through non-Deutsche Bank accounts.

### No Deutsche Bank Records for George Mitchell:

The Deutsche Bank transaction exhibits ([EFTA00027019](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00027019.pdf)) contain extensive records for **David J Mitchell** ($476K+) but **no records for George Mitchell or any entity associated with Senator Mitchell.** This could mean:
- Payments predated the Deutsche Bank account period
- Payments went through other banking channels
- Payments were in the form of personal checks or cash
- Payments were made through intermediary entities

---

## 12. MITCHELL'S PUBLIC DENIALS

### August 9, 2019 -- Initial Denial:

Following the unsealing of Giuffre court documents:

> "The allegation contained in the released documents is false. I have never met, spoken with or had any contact with Ms. Giuffre. In my contacts with Mr. Epstein, I never observed or suspected any inappropriate conduct with underage girls. I only learned of his actions when they were reported in the media related to his prosecution in Florida. We have had no further contact."

### Key Claims and Documentary Contradictions:

| Mitchell Claim | Documentary Evidence |
|----------------|---------------------|
| "We have had no further contact" [after Florida prosecution] | Sept 2011: confirmed 4:15 meeting at Epstein's ([EFTA00428166](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00428166.pdf)); Jul 2012: Mitchell proactively called ([EFTA00408367](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00408367.pdf)); Feb 2013: two Gates lunch invitations; Nov 2013: scheduled appointment; Sept 2015: Mitchell's direct email reply with "Best regards to Jeffrey" ([EFTA00339592](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00339592.pdf)) |
| "Declined or deflected invitations" | Mitchell proactively called Groff (Jul 2012), confirmed meeting (Sept 2011), asked to meet Jes Staley "at another time" (Sept 2011), replied directly with travel schedule (Sept 2015). While some specific invitations were declined (Yom Kippur, Gates lunches), the characterization of passive deflection is contradicted by active reciprocation. |
| "I never observed or suspected any inappropriate conduct" | Ongoing social contact through at least Sept 2015 provides opportunity for observation |
| "I only learned of his actions when they were reported in the media" | Plausible but not verifiable |
| "I have never met, spoken with or had any contact with Ms. Giuffre" | Cannot be independently verified from available documents; Giuffre's sworn testimony states otherwise; FBI used photo identification procedure with a victim who named Mitchell |

### February 2026 -- Updated Denial:

Mitchell's spokesperson stated: "Senator Mitchell reiterates unequivocally that he never met, spoke with, or had any contact... with any underage women." He "profoundly regrets ever having known Jeffrey Epstein."

Mitchell's spokesperson also stated he "declined or deflected invitations from Epstein that came afterward" -- contradicted by the confirmed September 2011 meeting, the proactive July 2012 call, and the direct September 2015 email reply with "Best regards to Jeffrey," all documented in DS9 source emails.

---

## 13. PROMINENT NAMES LIST AND NTOC TIPS

### FBI Prominent Names Briefing ([EFTA01660622](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01660622.pdf)):

Senator George Mitchell **does NOT appear** on the FBI Prominent Names page ([EFTA01660622](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01660622.pdf), page 17) that lists Trump, Weinstein, Prince Andrew, Staley, Black, Dubin, Wexner, Dershowitz, Clinton, Lutnick, and Barr.

### NTOC Tips ([EFTA01660651](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01660651.pdf), [EFTA01660679](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01660679.pdf)):

Mitchell does not appear in the main NTOC tips compilations. However, DS9 contains a separate NTOC tip ([EFTA00277082](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00277082.pdf)) claiming Mitchell was "on Epstein's plane" based on "published flight records" (see Source 5 above).

### Assessment:

Mitchell's absence from the Prominent Names list and NTOC tips may indicate:
- The FBI considered the allegations less substantiated than those against individuals on the list
- Mitchell's alleged conduct did not generate independent third-party tips
- The allegations came primarily through Giuffre's testimony and the separate victim journal, rather than NTOC reporting channels

---

## 14. PHILADELPHIA ARCHDIOCESE IRONY

**Document Reference:** Philadelphia Inquirer reporting, August 2019

In November 2018, George Mitchell was appointed as chairman of the oversight committee for the **Archdiocese of Philadelphia's Independent Reconciliation and Reparations Program (IRRP)** -- a compensation fund for clergy sexual abuse victims.

- Under his oversight, the fund distributed more than **$19.6 million to over 79 abuse victims**
- He served from November 2018 through May 2019
- He stepped down citing "new work commitments at his law firm, DLA Piper"
- In August 2019, Giuffre's allegations against Mitchell were unsealed

**The juxtaposition:** The person selected to oversee the Catholic Church's major reparations effort for sexual abuse victims was himself accused of sexual abuse by at least two individuals in the Epstein case. His role required evaluating the credibility and suffering of abuse victims while he was, according to those accusers, himself an abuser. Mitchell has denied all such allegations.

---

## 15. 2026 CONSEQUENCES

Following the DOJ release of 3+ million pages of Epstein investigation files containing **300+ references to Mitchell**, the consequences have been substantial:

### Institutional Severing:

| Date | Action |
|------|--------|
| Feb 1, 2026 | US-Ireland Alliance removed Mitchell's name from the George J. Mitchell Scholarship |
| Feb 5, 2026 | Mitchell resigned as honorary chair of the Mitchell Institute (Maine education charity) |
| Feb 2026 | Queen's University Belfast removed Mitchell's bust from campus |
| Feb 2026 | Queen's University Belfast removed Mitchell's name from its Institute for Global Peace, Security and Justice |
| Feb 2026 | Mitchell Institute considering a potential name change |

### Significance:

Mitchell's reputation as architect of the Good Friday Agreement -- one of the most significant diplomatic achievements of the late 20th century -- is being systematically dismantled. Institutions that once honored his peace work are severing ties based on the Epstein allegations.

## 17. PROSECUTORIAL ASSESSMENT

### Evidence Summary:

**For prosecution:**
1. **Two independent victim statements naming Mitchell:**
   - Virginia Giuffre ([EFTA00022133](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00022133.pdf)): sworn testimony that Epstein and Maxwell "told her to have sex with" Mitchell
   - Unnamed victim journal ([EFTA02731420](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2012/EFTA02731420.pdf)): "even old senators like George Mitchell who you think would be good like a grandpa are bad"
2. **FBI investigative document:** Alleges "multiday trips" in California and Washington, D.C. (2003-2004)
3. **Confirmed ongoing relationship:** At least 20 DS9 source emails document sustained contact from September 2011 through September 2015, including confirmed meetings, proactive calls from Mitchell, and direct email replies. Epstein claimed "very close friend" as late as December 2018.
4. **Financial connection:** Epstein paid for Mitchell's philanthropic projects and organized fundraisers
5. **Operational infrastructure:** Groff (NPA co-conspirator) managed Mitchell contact through State Department channels and through 4 separate assistants (Julia Reed, Janice, Neal, Maher Bitar)
6. **Mitchell's denial contradicted by documents:** Claimed "no further contact" and "declined or deflected invitations," contradicted by confirmed September 2011 meeting, proactive July 2012 call, and direct September 2015 email reply with "Best regards to Jeffrey"
7. **Jes Staley introduction:** Mitchell expressed interest in meeting Jes Staley through Epstein (Sept 2011); Staley was later classified as having engaged in sexual conduct with Epstein's victims
8. **FBI photo identification:** Victim identified Mitchell through a photo identification procedure during FBI interview ([EFTA00162974](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00162974.pdf))
9. **Social draw strategy:** Epstein planned to use Mitchell's attendance to attract Summers and Barak to events

**Against prosecution:**
1. **No flight log evidence:** Mitchell not found in digitized flight logs
2. **No financial records:** No Deutsche Bank wire transfers to Mitchell
3. **Denial under potential oath:** Mitchell categorically denies all allegations
4. **Statute of limitations:** Alleged conduct from 2003-2004 would face significant SOL challenges
5. **Giuffre credibility challenges:** Defense attorneys have challenged aspects of Giuffre's testimony
6. **Absence from Prominent Names list and NTOC tips:** FBI may not have prioritized Mitchell

### Pattern Analysis:

Mitchell fits the documented pattern of Epstein's "lending out" of victims to powerful men:
- Like Bill Richardson, Mitchell was a senior Democratic politician
- Like Richardson, the allegation involves Maxwell directing the victim
- Like Richardson, Mitchell has categorically denied the allegations
- Like Richardson, the denial is partially contradicted by documentary evidence of ongoing contact
- Like Richardson, Mitchell was never subpoenaed, never required to testify under oath, and never charged

### Why Mitchell Was Never Charged:

1. **Statute of limitations and evidentiary challenges:** The 2003-2004 timeframe of the alleged conduct would have presented significant legal obstacles by the time SDNY could have acted
2. **Institutional factors:** Mitchell's status as a former Senate Majority Leader and peace negotiator may have been a factor, though no documentary evidence of reluctance based on his stature was found in the files
3. **SDNY prioritization:** SDNY focused on Epstein and Maxwell, not named associates
4. **Victim credibility challenges:** Giuffre's allegations against multiple individuals created potential defense arguments
5. **Age:** Mitchell is now 92 years old; prosecution prospects diminished further with time

### Comparison to Richardson:

The Mitchell case is structurally similar to the Richardson case (documented in RICHARDSON_SDNY_COVERUP.md):
- Both named by Giuffre in sworn testimony
- Both maintained post-conviction contact with Epstein
- Both issued categorical denials
- Both had denials partially contradicted by documentary evidence
- Neither was ever required to testify under oath about specific allegations
- Neither was ever charged

However, the Richardson case generated **more internal SDNY documentation** ([EFTA00024683](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00024683.pdf) videoconference, [EFTA00014372](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00014372.pdf) prosecutor frustration, [EFTA00014374](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00014374.pdf) counsel call memo), while the Mitchell case has **fewer SDNY-specific records** in the databases searched.

## CONCLUSION

Senator George Mitchell's entanglement with Jeffrey Epstein is documented across five distinct evidentiary categories in the DOJ files:

1. **Two independent victim statements** naming him as an abuser ([EFTA00022133](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00022133.pdf), [EFTA02731420](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2012/EFTA02731420.pdf)), with FBI photo identification procedure corroborating the identification ([EFTA00162974](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00162974.pdf))
2. **20+ DS9 source emails** documenting sustained, reciprocal post-conviction contact from September 2011 through September 2015, including confirmed meetings, proactive calls from Mitchell, and direct email replies with "Best regards to Jeffrey"
3. **Operational infrastructure** connecting Epstein's office to Mitchell through 5 contacts (Ann Ungar, Julia Reed, Janice, Neal, Maher Bitar), the US State Department, and Mitchell's personal cell number on Epstein's master contact list
4. **Mitchell's own admission** of friendship and financial support ([EFTA00013640](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00013640.pdf))
5. **FBI investigative documentation** of multiday trips with a victim (per press reporting of DOJ release)

Mitchell's 2019 denial that there was "no further contact" after Epstein's Florida prosecution is comprehensively contradicted by DS9 source documents: a confirmed September 2011 meeting at Epstein's residence, a proactive July 2012 call from Mitchell offering weekend contact, two Gates lunch invitations (February 2013), a scheduled November 2013 appointment, and a direct September 2015 email reply sharing his travel schedule and sending "Best regards to Jeffrey." The spokesperson claim that Mitchell "declined or deflected invitations" is partially accurate (he declined the Yom Kippur dinner and Gates lunches) but fundamentally misleading -- the documentary record shows warm, reciprocal engagement, not passive deflection.

DS9 also reveals that Epstein used Mitchell as a social draw to attract other targets (planning to leverage a Mitchell confirmation to invite Summers and Barak), attempted to introduce Mitchell to Jes Staley (later named in prosecution classifications), and maintained Mitchell as the first name on his master contact list alongside 50+ other high-value associates.

The evidence, while not reaching the level of the Leon Black case (4+ victims, $118M+ financial flows, FBI 302s), is comparable in structure to the Bill Richardson case -- two-victim sworn testimony, sustained post-conviction contact, categorical denial contradicted by documents, and ultimately no prosecution.

As of February 2026, the institutional consequences have been severe: Mitchell has resigned from his namesake organizations, and international institutions have severed ties. He has never been required to testify under oath about the specific allegations, and at 92 years old, prosecution is effectively impossible.
