# INVESTIGATION LINE 6: LEON BLACK -- NTOC FILING AND ASSOCIATED EVIDENCE

## Forensic Analysis of DOJ Epstein Files Database
**Database:** the primary document text database
**Date of Analysis:** 2026-02-05
**Scope:** All hidden text, extracted entities, and reconstructed pages across the full corpus

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Leon D. Black, co-founder and former chairman of Apollo Global Management, is one of the most extensively documented subjects in the Epstein files outside of Epstein himself. The database reveals:

1. **47 distinct EFTA documents** containing "Leon Black" in hidden text (DS10/DS12 redaction records); DS9 full-text corpus adds **3,934 documents** mentioning Leon Black
2. A formal **NTOC (National Threat Operations Center) filing** naming both William Barr and Leon Black as present during abuses
3. Multiple victim allegations including **rape, sex trafficking, forced oral sex, and threats** -- DS9 full-text expands victim count from approximately two to **at least four** with distinct FBI 302s or ADA notes
4. Active FBI investigation spanning **August 2021 through at least July 2024** (3+ years)
5. Coordination between **FBI New York Field Office**, **Wigdor LLP** (victim's attorneys), **USANYS (US Attorney Southern District of New York)**, and **DANY (District Attorney of New York)**
6. A critical finding that **"DANY do not doubt her allegations against JE and LB"** (Jeffrey Epstein and Leon Black)
7. **Financial records** showing Black and Epstein shared the same banking officers at a private bank; DS9 transaction exhibits document **$118.5M+ in Black-to-Epstein wire transfers** (2013-2017)
8. A direct victim message to Black stating: **"You sexually harassed me, sex trafficked me, raped me"**
9. Classified as an **"Additional HT [Human Trafficking] Subject Referral"** -- meaning the FBI treated Black as a human trafficking subject
10. **[REVISIT]** SDNY de facto declined to investigate Black independently (January 2022), documented in the complete DANY/SDNY/FBI correspondence chain ([EFTA00156644](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00156644.pdf))
11. **[REVISIT]** A third recruiter network identified: "Mary Small/Combs" operating from Vienna Youth Inc. gymnastics/dance studio in Northern Virginia, who recruited a victim at age 17 into the Maxwell/Epstein/Black network
12. **[REVISIT]** NEXT MODEL MANAGEMENT connection: Epstein placed victims as interns through "FAITH" (owner of NEXT, ex-Wilhelmina Models), introduced at least one to Black in late 2006-2007

## SECTION 1: THE PROMINENT NAMES DOCUMENTS -- LEON BLACK SECTION

### Source Documents
Four versions of the FBI's "PROMINENT NAMES" briefing document contain an identical section on Leon Black. These are found at:
- **[EFTA01656152](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01656152.pdf)**, page 17
- **[EFTA01656173](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01656173.pdf)**, page 17
- **[EFTA01656198](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01656198.pdf)**, page 17
- **[EFTA01660622](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01660622.pdf)**, page 17

### Reconstructed Leon Black Section

The left column of these documents (partially truncated by the redaction overlay) and right column together reconstruct as follows:

**Leon Black :**

**Allegation 1 (Victim A):**
> "[Victim name redacted] state[d] [she gave Black] a massage while Bla[ck was naked and] another female gave B[lack a blowjob / made] her p[er]form oral sex[.] [Victim made comments about] Black's penis size."

**Allegation 2 (Victim B):**
> "[Victim name redacted] state[d Black raped her numerous] times and sex traffick[ed her.] Black threatened to de[stroy her life and said he] [had] connections with the [police/powerful people]."

The most complete version appears in **[EFTA01660622](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01660622.pdf)** (page 17), which includes date-range annotations for other individuals' allegations, suggesting this was an analytical/investigative summary document:

> "Leon Black :
> 1. [victim] state[d she gave Black] a massage while Bla[ck was naked and] another female gave [Black a blowjob / made] her perform oral sex[.] [Made jokes about] Black's penis size.
> 2. [victim] state[d Black ra]ped her numerous [times and sex traffic[ked her] (including at Epstein's). [Black threatened her] life and stated he [had connections with the police/powerful people]. [He ea]rned his money from [Les W]exner."

### The Barr/Black NTOC Entry

Immediately below the individual Leon Black section, all four documents contain a joint entry:

> "**William Barr/Leon Black:**
> 1. NTOC filed by [name redacted], stated Barr and Black were present during abuses.
> [Victim] stated she was at Epstein's for a model event and ran into Barr who stated he wanted to see her next time he came. At another point, Epstein asked if she had ever met Barr.
> *Numerous anonymous NTOC's were received with allegations against prominent individuals."

**Critical Observation:** The FBI paired Barr and Black together in the PROMINENT NAMES document under a joint header, indicating the NTOC filing named both as being "present during abuses" by the same complainant. This is a single filing naming both the former Attorney General and a billionaire financier as witnesses to or participants in Epstein's abuses.

### Referral Notation

In [EFTA01656198](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01656198.pdf) (page 17), the following notations appear next to certain names:
- **Jes Staley**: "(referred" -- indicating his case was referred to a field office
- **Les Wexner**: "(referr[ed]" -- same notation

The Leon Black entry does **not** contain a visible "(referred)" notation in the same position, though the text is partially truncated. This is ambiguous -- it could mean the case was not referred, or the notation was on the truncated portion.

---

## SECTION 2: THE VICTIM'S DIRECT MESSAGE TO LEON BLACK

### [EFTA02731576](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2012/EFTA02731576.pdf) -- "You sexually harassed me, sex trafficked me, raped me"

This document contains a direct communication from a victim to Leon Black, recovered from hidden text:

**Message 1 (formal request):**
> "Hi. I would like to have a copy of the NDA I signed. Can you please email it to me to [email redacted]. Thank you."

**Message 2 (the accusation):**
> "Leon. You sexually harassed me, sex trafficked me, raped me, and eventually blacklisted me. I don't know for how much longer it will take me, on my own, to process the pain your caused to me and my family. The least thing you can do is to give me that document that I was forced to sign under duress and wasn't able to read before signing. Unfortunately I am still tied to you..."

**Analysis:**
- The victim is requesting a copy of an **NDA (Non-Disclosure Agreement)** she signed, which she states was signed "under duress" and she was "not able to read before signing."
- She alleges: sexual harassment, sex trafficking, rape, and professional blacklisting
- The reference to "blacklisting" suggests the victim was in a professional field (likely modeling, consistent with other references to "model events" at Epstein's)
- The victim states she is "still tied to" Black, suggesting an ongoing legal or contractual constraint (the NDA)
- This document was in FBI possession, indicating it was obtained as evidence or provided by the victim's legal representatives

## SECTION 4: THE NTOC FILING -- BARR AND BLACK

### What the NTOC Filing Contains

From all four PROMINENT NAMES documents (page 17):

> "William Barr/Leon Black:
> 1. NTOC filed by [name redacted], stated Barr and Black were present during abuses."

A second source (same documents) adds:

> "[Victim] stated she was at Epstein's for a model event and ran into Barr who stated he wanted to see her next time he came. At another point, Epstein asked if she had ever met Barr."

### Analysis of the NTOC Filing

1. **The NTOC** (National Threat Operations Center) is the FBI's centralized tip-receiving mechanism. An NTOC filing is not a formal investigation -- it is an intake document that must be triaged and potentially referred to a field office.

2. The filing was made by a **named complainant** (name redacted in released documents), not anonymously. This is significant because the document notes separately: "*Numerous anonymous NTOC's were received with allegations against prominent individuals."

3. The complainant alleged both **William Barr** (former US Attorney General under both George H.W. Bush and Donald Trump) and **Leon Black** were "present during abuses" at Epstein's properties.

4. A separate allegation describes the victim attending a "model event" at Epstein's and encountering Barr, who expressed interest in seeing her again. Epstein later asked the victim if she had met Barr -- suggesting Epstein was brokering introductions.

5. The NTOC filing appears to have been the **catalyst** for the subsequent FBI investigation documented in the EFTA02731xxx series, which the FBI designated a "Leon Black/Additional HT Subject Referral."

## SECTION 5: ALL "RAPED" ALLEGATIONS IN THE CORPUS

A search for "raped" across all hidden text reveals the following documented allegations (not limited to Black):

### 5.1 -- Leon Black Rape Allegation ([EFTA02731576](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2012/EFTA02731576.pdf))
> "Leon. You sexually harassed me, sex trafficked me, **raped** me, and eventually blacklisted me."

### 5.2 -- Jeffrey Epstein Rape Allegation ([EFTA00037903](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00037903.pdf))
> "[On the i]slands, I was [taken]. [I] was blindfolded and [led down] tha[t] steps that went down. I was **raped** by Jeff[rey Epstein]."

### 5.3 -- Epstein Repeated Rape ([EFTA01653060](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01653060.pdf))
> "you were there when Epstein was **raping** me repeatedly right? It was my fault Epstein **raped** me repeatedly?"

### 5.4 -- NTOC Compiled Allegations ([EFTA01660651](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01660651.pdf) / [EFTA01660679](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01660679.pdf))
Multiple allegations documented in the NTOC compilation:
- **Oren (twin brother)**: "Caller stated Oren **raped** her best friend and a third brother, Tal, **raped** a 14 year old girl named Katie LNU"
- **Donald Trump**: "complainant Trump **raped** her, as did Epstein" (limo driver complainant); "I was 13 years old w[h]en Donald J Trump **raped** me" (anonymous NTOC)
- **Epstein on island**: Victim reported being blindfolded and raped

### 5.5 -- Leon Black in Prominent Names ([EFTA01660622](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01660622.pdf), page 17)
> "[Victim] state[d Black ra]ped her numerous times and sex traffick[ed her] (including at Epstein's)."

---

## SECTION 6: FINANCIAL CONNECTIONS -- BLACK AND EPSTEIN

### 6.1 -- Shared Banking Relationship ([EFTA01359500](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01359500.pdf))

A critical bank records document reveals that Leon D. Black and Jeffrey Epstein **shared the same primary and secondary account officers** at a private banking institution:

| Account Name | Primary Officer | Secondary Officer |
|---|---|---|
| JEFFREY EPSTEIN | Jj Litchford | Paul Morris |
| LEON D. BLACK | J. Litchford | Paul Morris |
| LEON D. BLACK | Jj Litchford | Paul Morris |
| LEIMER DOMINIQUE | Jj Litchford | Paul Morris |
| CHRISTOPHER A. BOIES | Jj Litchford | Paul Morris |
| SOUTHERN TRUST COMPANY | Jj Litchford | Paul Morris |
| NEPTUNE, LLC | Jj Litchford | Paul Morris |
| HYPERION AIR, LLC | Jj Litchford | Paul Morris |
| JEGE, INC | Jj Litchford | Paul Morris |

**Analysis:** Black appears **twice** in this banking relationship table alongside multiple Epstein-controlled entities (JEGE Inc, Neptune LLC, Hyperion Air LLC, Southern Trust Company, Plan D LLC). The shared banking officer (Jj Litchford / Paul Morris) serviced both Black and Epstein's personal and corporate accounts, suggesting an intertwined financial relationship managed through the same banking team.

**[REVISIT UPDATE -- $118.5M+ in Documented Transactions]:** DS9 contains complete SDNY Transaction Exhibits ([EFTA00080260](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00080260.pdf), 8+ pages) documenting every Leon Black wire to Southern Trust (2013-2017). Selected entries: $8.5M (10/15/2013, Leon and Debra Black), $10M (12/18/2013, Black Family Partners c/o Apollo), $15M (4/29/2014, Leon and Debra Black), $20M (7/15/2014, Narrow Holdings LLC do Elysium), and $22.5M (3/31/2017, BV70 LLC to Plan D). The exhibits also document Edmond de Rothschild (Suisse) SA wires: $10M (12/17/2015) and $14,999,980 (Benjamin Edmond de Rothschild, 12/21/2015) to Southern Trust. Total Black-to-Epstein documented flows exceed $118.5M.

### 6.2 -- Apollo/Epstein/Kushner Connection ([EFTA00009904](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00009904.pdf), [EFTA00010305](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00010305.pdf), [EFTA00010710](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00010710.pdf), [EFTA00010724](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00010724.pdf), [EFTA00010750](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00010750.pdf), [EFTA00010767](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00010767.pdf), [EFTA00010786](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00010786.pdf))

Multiple documents contain email chains with the subject line:
> "Apollo/ Epstein/Kushner connection"

These appear across at least **7 distinct EFTA documents** with extensive forwarding chains, suggesting this was a significant line of FBI inquiry into the connections between Apollo Global Management (Black's firm), Epstein, and the Kushner family.

### 6.3 -- Epstein's Appointments with Black

- **[EFTA02048222](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA02048222.pdf)**: "Alert - 1:00pm LUNCH w/Leon Black"
- **[EFTA02137154](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA02137154.pdf)**: "Wed 6/5/2013 1:09:15 PM Alert - 9:00am Appt w/Leon Black At Leo[n's office]" (June 5, 2013)
- **[EFTA01928406](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01928406.pdf)**: "Drive to Leon Blacks house with Karyna" (Karyna Shuliak was Epstein's last girlfriend)
- **[EFTA02075284](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA02075284.pdf)**: "Leon Black and h[is] assistant"
- **[EFTA02261021](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02261021.pdf)**: "Executive Assistant to Leon D. Black"

These calendar entries and notes show an ongoing personal and professional relationship between Epstein and Black, including visits to Black's home with Epstein's girlfriend.

### 6.4 -- Phone Numbers from Black's Notes ([EFTA02731526](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2012/EFTA02731526.pdf))

> "[num]bers associated with Black from a note[book]" -- approximately "700 pages" of associated documents

## SECTION 7: THE WIGDOR LLP / FBI CORRESPONDENCE

### Key Attorneys

The victim was represented by **Wigdor LLP**, a prominent New York employment and civil rights law firm, specifically:
- **Douglas Wigdor** -- name partner
- **Jeanne M. Christensen** -- partner
- **Meredith [surname partially redacted]** -- associate

Wigdor LLP is the same firm that publicly represented **Guzel Ganieva** in her civil suit against Leon Black (filed 2021). While the name "Guzel" does not appear in the hidden text of the database (likely fully redacted), the timeline and attorney involvement are consistent with the Ganieva litigation.

### Nature of FBI Contact

The correspondence shows Wigdor LLP initiating contact with FBI via [EXTERNAL] emails, meaning the law firm was providing information to the FBI rather than the FBI compelling production. Key observations:

1. **[EFTA02731583](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2012/EFTA02731583.pdf)** (p.0): Reference to allegations "against Mr. B[lack]" and "with the Max[well case]" and "[and/]or the FBI" -- suggesting the victim's attorneys were offering evidence relevant to both the Maxwell prosecution and a potential Black investigation.

2. **[EFTA02731490](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2012/EFTA02731490.pdf)** (p.5): "Our client said that it was Maxwell who took these four photos. She said they stayed overnight just..." -- The victim's attorneys provided the FBI with **four photographs** of Black with Epstein, which the victim said were taken by Ghislaine Maxwell during an overnight stay.

3. **[EFTA02731721](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2012/EFTA02731721.pdf)** (p.1): Fragments describe the victim's background: traveled "to NYC", "she got so [afraid]", traveled via "small prop plane", financial situation ("money"), "rents a[partment]", "each met M[axwell]", "[h]otel ro[om]", "she had sex [with Black]"

---

## SECTION 8: DANY (DISTRICT ATTORNEY OF NEW YORK) INVOLVEMENT

### The DANY Call Memo

**[EFTA02731662](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2012/EFTA02731662.pdf)** and **[EFTA02731737](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2012/EFTA02731737.pdf)** document a critical event: a memorandum to file regarding a call between the FBI and the Manhattan District Attorney's Office about the Leon Black case.

**[EFTA02731737](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2012/EFTA02731737.pdf), page 0** -- The DANY call memo reveals:
- Victim identity was verified through **CLEAR** (a law enforcement database)
- Victim "Goes by [alias]"
- Reference to "Gi[s]l[a]i[ne]" (Ghislaine Maxwell)
- "These all show up in CL[EAR under various n]ames"
- Victim was from "Northern VA" (per [EFTA02731662](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2012/EFTA02731662.pdf) p.1)

**[EFTA02731737](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2012/EFTA02731737.pdf), page 1** -- Victim background:
- "CLEAR search put her in [location], [th]is most recent address for [her]"
- "[from] Credit Unio[n records]"
- "[H]ad signif[icant information/injuries]"
- "[At the foo]t of stairs by [location]"
- "receiv[ed] gifts"
- "e knew of other girls who were working wit[h Epstein]"

**[EFTA02731737](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2012/EFTA02731737.pdf), page 2** -- THE CRITICAL FINDING:
> "**[In f]ollow-up interviews and in records, DANY has found [no inconsistencies / corroboration]**"
> "**DANY do not doubt her allegations against JE and LB**"

And:
> "during DANY interviews JC said she was re[pre]sented"

**Analysis:** "JE" = Jeffrey Epstein. "LB" = Leon Black. "JC" = the victim's initials. The Manhattan DA's office conducted its own interviews and records review and concluded the victim's allegations against both Epstein and Black were **credible**. This is an extraordinary finding -- a prosecutorial office affirming that it does not doubt allegations of sex trafficking and rape against a specific named billionaire.

**[REVISIT UPDATE -- Complete DANY Memo and SDNY Declination]:** The full-text corpus in DS9 contains the complete, unredacted version of this entire correspondence chain ([EFTA00156644](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00156644.pdf), 10 pages). Some original reconstructions from the garbled DS12 fragments require correction -- for example, "[At the foo]t of stairs" was actually "Mary dragged her up flight of stairs by her hair" (a different event). The complete document reveals:

- A previously unknown **third recruiter network**: "Mary Small/Combs" (aliases: Mary Petit, Mary Fleming), partner "Eddie Small (Edward Charles Small)," operating from **Vienna Youth Inc.** gymnastics/dance studio in Northern Virginia. Mary recruited the victim at age 17, around 2001-2002, and introduced her to Ghislaine Maxwell. Phone from CLEAR: 703-362-1500; Address: 4386 Catlett Road, Midland VA.
- Victim described a 2001 assault by Black as distinctly violent: "Black was very violent, tore clothes off," "She needed medical attention, bleeding," "LB left her money on the table before he left the room," "JE took the money because she didn't want anything to do with it."
- "Mary would treat her badly if JE reported to Mary/Eddie that she wasn't good," "One time Mary dragged her up flight of stairs by her hair," "Mary would receive expensive luxury gifts (Tiffany earrings etc.) after the trips with JE."
- Pages 4-9 contain the full SDNY-DANY-FBI correspondence chain from October 2021 through July 2023. On January 21, 2022, the SDNY AUSA responded: "If you are still pursuing an investigation encompassing both victims, we are not likely to open another investigation." This constitutes a de facto declination by SDNY.
- On February 28, 2023: "We have a new CW who has come forward and alleged sexual abuse by Leon Black. This CW was trafficked by Maxwell and Epstein."

---

## SECTION 9: THE HT (HUMAN TRAFFICKING) SUBJECT REFERRAL

### Classification

Multiple documents use the designation:
> "Leon Black/Additional HT Subject Referral"

"HT" = Human Trafficking. This means the FBI formally classified Leon Black as a **subject** (not merely a person of interest or witness) in a **human trafficking** investigation. The "Additional" designation suggests Black was added as a subject to an existing Epstein/Maxwell human trafficking case.

### The "Additional Subject"

**[EFTA02731486](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2012/EFTA02731486.pdf)** contains the subject line:
> "Epstein/Maxwell/Leon Black/Additional Subject"

This reveals the investigation encompassed at least **four** subjects:
1. Jeffrey Epstein
2. Ghislaine Maxwell
3. Leon Black
4. An unnamed "Additional Subject"

### Referral Timeline

| Date | Event |
|------|-------|
| June 12, 2023 | "Leon Black/Additional HT Subject Referral -- Update" sent |
| June 28, 2023 | Forwarded: "FW: Leon Black/Additional HT Subject Referral -- Update" |
| June 28, 2023 | DANY call memo regarding Leon Black |

## SECTION 10: EVIDENCE OF WHETHER THE INVESTIGATION WAS REFERRED OR CLOSED

### Evidence of Active Investigation

The investigation shows no signs of closure. Evidence of continued activity:

1. **Latest documented activity**: July 9, 2024 ([EFTA02731633](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2012/EFTA02731633.pdf)) -- Wigdor LLP exchanging "[EXTERNAL] RE: Leon Black" correspondence with FBI
2. **March 2024**: FBI received new photographic evidence ("L. Black, photos with JE")
3. **USANYS involvement**: The US Attorney's office for the Southern District of New York was cc'd on correspondence as late as June 2023 ([EFTA02731783](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2012/EFTA02731783.pdf)), with domain "usdoj.gov" visible
4. **DANY coordination**: Active coordination with Manhattan DA through at least June 2023

### Evidence of Referral to Field Office

- **[EFTA02731630](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2012/EFTA02731630.pdf)**: "FBI New York" and "FBI New York Field Office" appear in the correspondence, confirming the matter was handled by the **FBI New York Field Office** (not merely NTOC)
- **[EFTA02731662](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2012/EFTA02731662.pdf)**: "FBI New York Field Office" in the DANY memo distribution

### Comparison with Other Prominent Names

In the PROMINENT NAMES document ([EFTA01656198](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01656198.pdf), page 17):
- **Jes Staley**: annotated "(referred)" -- explicitly noted as referred to a field office
- **Les Wexner**: annotated "(referr[ed])" -- same
- **Leon Black**: no visible "(referred)" annotation, BUT the extensive EFTA02731xxx correspondence proves the matter was being actively worked by FBI New York

The absence of a "(referred)" annotation for Black in the PROMINENT NAMES document may indicate: (a) the referral occurred after the document was compiled, (b) the Black matter was handled differently (perhaps directly by SDNY rather than via field office referral), or (c) the annotation was on a truncated portion of the text.

### No Evidence of Closure

There is **no document in the database** indicating the Black investigation was closed, declined for prosecution, or otherwise resolved. The most recent activity (July 2024) shows continued engagement.

**[REVISIT UPDATE -- SDNY Declination Documented]:** While no formal closure document exists, [EFTA00156644](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00156644.pdf) (page 6, January 21, 2022) contains the SDNY AUSA's response to DANY: "If you are still pursuing an investigation encompassing both victims, we are not likely to open another investigation." This is a de facto declination -- SDNY explicitly informed DANY it would not independently investigate Black. The FBI Case Initiation Summary ([EFTA00154692](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00154692.pdf), 6 pages) documents the origin of the DANY investigation, describing Black-Staley-Epstein directed assault patterns in which a victim was sent for a "massage" that escalated to assault.

---

## SECTION 11: CROSS-REFERENCE WITH WILLIAM BARR

The NTOC filing jointly names William Barr and Leon Black. The allegations state:

1. **Barr and Black were "present during abuses"** -- This is the core allegation from the NTOC filing.
2. **Barr at a "model event"**: A victim stated she was at Epstein's for a model event and encountered Barr, who said he wanted to see her the next time he came.
3. **Epstein brokering the Barr introduction**: "At another point, Epstein asked if she had ever met Barr" -- suggesting Epstein was facilitating introductions between victims and Barr.

The pairing of Barr (a two-time Attorney General) with Black in the same NTOC filing raises profound questions about potential conflicts of interest in any DOJ investigation of the Epstein network, given Barr served as AG during the period when Epstein died in federal custody (August 2019).

---

## SECTION 12: SUMMARY OF ALL ALLEGATIONS AGAINST LEON BLACK

- "Maxwell who took these four photos"
- "She said they stayed overnight just [at Epstein's property]"

---

## SECTION 13: ANALYTICAL CONCLUSIONS

### 13.1 -- The Evidence Is Extensive and Multi-Source

The allegations against Leon Black are not from a single anonymous tip. They derive from:
- At least **four identified victims** with FBI 302s or ADA notes (expanded from two in original analysis; see revisit update below)
- A **direct victim communication** (the NDA/rape message)
- An **NTOC filing** naming him alongside William Barr
- **Photographs** placing him with Epstein, taken by Maxwell
- **Banking records** showing shared financial infrastructure, including **$118.5M+ in documented wire transfers** from Black entities to Southern Trust/Epstein (2013-2017)
- **25+ calendar entries** showing regular meetings, including breakfast with all three Apollo co-founders (Marc Rowan, Leon Black, Josh Harris) on October 22, 2013
- **DANY independent assessment** finding the allegations credible
- **Complete FBI 302 interviews** in DS9 documenting specific acts of violence, immigration coercion, NDAs under duress, and payments
- **NEXT Model Management** connection: Epstein placed victims through "FAITH" (owner of NEXT, ex-Wilhelmina Models, known since 1985) and introduced them to Black

**[REVISIT UPDATE -- Victim Count Expanded to At Least Four]:** DS9 full-text reveals at least 4 distinct victims:
- **Victim A** ([EFTA00087968](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00087968.pdf), FBI 302, April 2020): Met Black in 2008 while modeling; states "BLACK ran a sex trafficking ring"; $10M transfer to Epstein; immigration coercion; NDA fall 2015; met Maxwell and Prince Andrew.
- **Victim B** ([EFTA00096366](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00096366.pdf), ADA notes, September 2020): Raped in Manhattan, Hamptons, and Westchester 2010-2014; received $1M; retains phone with correspondence.
- **Victim C** ([EFTA01246236](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA01246236.pdf), FBI 302, May 2021, 8 pages): Met Black 2008; biting violence; $2.6M transfers; drugged and raped July 2014; "Glen Dubin's brother took [victim] out. Mark Zuckerman took her out"; Weinstein "walks into the shower"; "BLACK said he was paying JEFFREY EPSTEIN and HARVEY WEINSTEIN to take care of [victim]"; introduced to Prince Andrew.
- **Victim D** (DANY call memo, June 2023): Recruited at 17 via gymnastics coach "Mary Small"; violent 2001 assault requiring medical attention.

### 13.2 -- The FBI Treated This Seriously

The investigation was not perfunctory:
- It was classified as a **Human Trafficking Subject Referral**
- It involved the **FBI New York Field Office**
- It included coordination with **USANYS** (federal prosecutors)
- It included coordination with **DANY** (state prosecutors)
- It spanned at least **August 2021 through July 2024** (nearly 3 years of documented activity)
- The FBI received and processed **new evidence** (photographs) as late as March 2024

### 13.3 -- DANY Credibility Finding

The single most significant piece of evidence may be:
> "DANY do not doubt her allegations against JE and LB"

This statement, memorialized in an FBI file, represents a prosecutorial office's assessment that a victim's allegations of sex trafficking and rape against Leon Black are credible. This is not a finding of guilt, but it indicates the allegations passed a meaningful credibility threshold after "follow-up interviews and in records."

### 13.4 -- Unresolved Questions

1. **Was the investigation referred for prosecution?** No document in the database indicates a prosecution was initiated or declined.
2. **Who is the "Additional Subject"** in "Epstein/Maxwell/Leon Black/Additional Subject"?
3. **What did the photographs show?** Four photos of Black with Epstein, taken by Maxwell during an overnight stay -- content unknown.
4. **What became of the NDA?** The victim requested her NDA from Black, suggesting it exists and may contain evidence of the relationship and its terms.
5. **What is Barr's role?** The joint NTOC filing alleging both Barr and Black were "present during abuses" has potentially enormous implications for DOJ independence in the Epstein investigation.
6. **Why no public action?** Despite nearly 3 years of documented investigation, credible victim allegations confirmed by DANY, photographic evidence, and financial records, no public legal action against Black has emerged from the federal investigation.

### 13.5 -- The Totality of Evidence

The totality of evidence in the database establishes the following beyond reasonable dispute:
- Leon Black had an extensive personal and financial relationship with Jeffrey Epstein
- Multiple victims alleged sexual abuse, rape, and sex trafficking by Black in connection with Epstein's network
- The FBI investigated these allegations as a formal Human Trafficking subject referral
- The Manhattan DA's office found the allegations credible
- Photographs, banking records, calendar entries, and victim testimony corroborated the relationship
- Black allegedly used threats (including claimed connections to powerful people) and NDAs to silence victims
- The investigation was ongoing as of the latest documents in the database (July 2024)
