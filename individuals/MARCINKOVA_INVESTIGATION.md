# NADIA MARCINKOVA / NADIA MARCINKO: FBI FILE INVESTIGATION

**Date:** 2026-02-06
**Subject:** Nadia Marcinkova (later Nadia Marcinko)
**Database Sources:** primary document text database, OCR text extraction database, image catalog database, Dataset 10 document text database, entity relationship database
**Total Records Searched:** 1,808,942 redaction records across 376,571 documents; 38,955 OCR records; knowledge graph with 524 entities and 2,096 relationships

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Nadia Marcinkova (now Nadia Marcinko) is one of the most significant and anomalous figures in the Epstein FBI files. Despite being identified as both a victim and a co-conspirator who "scheduled hundreds of sexual massages with minors for Epstein," her full name ("Marcinkova" or "Marcinko") returns **ZERO results** across 1.8 million redaction records and 38,955 OCR records. She appears only by first name ("Nadia") in a handful of redacted documents, through her company name "Aviloop LLC" in financial records, and extensively in flight logs through the knowledge graph.

**UPDATE (2026-02-12):** Full-text corpus revisit substantially revises this finding. DS9 alone contains **133 documents** with "Marcinkova" by full surname, **19 documents** with "Marcinko," and **61 documents** with "Aviloop." DS11 adds 1 document with "Marcinkova," 6 with "Marcinko," and 18 with "Aviloop." The total new document count exceeds **200 unique documents** across DS9/DS11. Marcinkova's name was not absent from the FBI files -- it appears extensively in court filings, NPA drafts, prosecution memos, civil litigation exhibits, news articles, FBI intelligence reports, and direct email correspondence. The correct characterization is that her name was systematically redacted in *internal FBI materials* (DS8/DS10/DS12) but remained visible in court records and publicly-filed documents comprising much of DS9. See the "DS9/DS11 Evidence" section below for additional findings including: FBI certification as a trafficking victim (I-914), a $10M trust annuity, the full NPA text with immigration waiver, an FBI intelligence dossier, an aircraft brokerage agreement, and extensive email correspondence revealing Aviloop as a visa-fraud vehicle.

The investigation reveals:
- Marcinkova was on **124 documented flights** with Epstein (Sept 2003 - Jan 2006), more than almost any other individual
- She flew on the same flights as **Prince Andrew** (Oct 16-17, 2004), **Jean-Luc Brunel** (11 flights), and **Ghislaine Maxwell** (20 flights)
- Epstein wired **$100,000 to Aviloop LLC** (Marcinkova's company) on November 30, 2018 -- just two days after the Miami Herald series exposed his crimes
- SDNY prosecutors described her as "another Epstein co-conspirator who scheduled hundreds of sexual massages with minors for Epstein but was also a victim of his sexual abuse"
- She was named in the Non-Prosecution Agreement (NPA) as a "potential co-conspirator" for whom "Epstein obtained protection"
- Her identity document ([EFTA01525405](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01525405.pdf)) exists only in redaction data, not OCR -- meaning it was fully redacted in the released files

---

## SECTION 1: THE ANOMALY -- SYSTEMATIC NAME REDACTION

### 1.1 Zero Full-Name Results in Redaction Databases

Search across all five redaction/OCR databases for "Marcinkova" and "Marcinko" returned:
- **primary document text database:** 0 results for full surname
- **OCR text extraction database:** 0 results for full surname
- **image catalog database:** 0 results for full surname
- **Dataset 10 document text database:** 0 results for full surname

The ONLY instance of her surname appearing in any redaction database is a garbled extraction from her identity document:

> **[EFTA01525405](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01525405.pdf), Page 0 (Hidden Text):** `ffl illMIEffi ardv d. iLfi NADIA LIAlbCINKOVA`

This is clearly a corrupted OCR reading of "NADIA MARCINKOVA" from behind a redaction layer.

### 1.2 Significance -- Revised (2026-02-12)

**Original assessment:** The zero-result finding was interpreted as "systematic identity suppression" across all FBI files. **Revised assessment:** The zero results were an artifact of searching only redaction-extraction databases (which capture hidden text behind redactions in internal FBI materials). The full-text corpus (DS9/DS11) contains **200+ documents** with Marcinkova's name in court filings, NPA drafts, civil litigation, news articles, and FBI intelligence reports. The suppression was selective -- her name was systematically redacted in internal FBI materials (DS8/DS10/DS12 redaction layers) but remained visible in court records and publicly-filed documents included in DS9. This represents selective redaction in internal FBI materials. Whether this reflects victim privacy protections (she was later certified as a trafficking victim via I-914), deliberate concealment, or standard redaction practices is not established.

---

## SECTION 2: DOCUMENTS CONFIRMED TO REFERENCE NADIA

Despite the name suppression, Nadia appears by first name only in the following documents:

### 2.1 Identity Document -- [EFTA01525405](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01525405.pdf)
- **Type:** Identity document (passport or ID card)
- **Hidden text:** `NADIA LIAlbCINKOVA` (garbled OCR of "NADIA MARCINKOVA")
- **Status:** Fully redacted; NOT in OCR text records; exists only in redaction analysis
- **Significance:** An identity document for Marcinkova was collected by the FBI, but its content is entirely redacted in the released files

### 2.2 Bank Record -- [EFTA01286686](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01286686.pdf)
- **Type:** Financial transaction record
- **Hidden text (Page 1):** `g Money Trust`
- **Hidden text (Page 1):** `TO BANK 039270903 Preauthorized Debit`
- **Hidden text (Page 2):** `TOMBANK NA AC 4312480538 NADIA`
- **Hidden text (Page 2):** `TO JPAIOROAN CHASE BANK. NA NC 3411 34927 SIEHMET VIDA BESKAR1WS FSO`
- **Interpretation:** Transaction from the "Money Trust" (an Epstein trust entity) through TD Bank (account 4312480538 in the name of NADIA) to JPMorgan Chase Bank. This documents direct financial flows from Epstein's trust structure to an account in Nadia's name.

### 2.3 Email -- [EFTA01767810](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01767810.pdf) (October 2012)
- **Type:** Email communication
- **Hidden text:** `com> To: Nadia wr=te:`
- **Hidden text:** `day, Octobe= 15, 2012 11:49 PM`
- **Status:** NOT in OCR text records; content only visible through redaction analysis
- **Significance:** Email to Nadia dated October 15, 2012 -- demonstrating continued contact years after the 2008 NPA and Epstein's Florida conviction

### 2.4 Email -- [EFTA01825863](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01825863.pdf)
- **Type:** Email communication
- **Hidden text:** `nadia bject:` (fragment of "Subject:")
- **Status:** NOT in OCR text records; fully redacted

### 2.5 Email -- [EFTA02025999](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA02025999.pdf)
- **Type:** Email communication
- **Hidden text:** `Cc: nadia Subject:`
- **Status:** NOT in OCR text records; fully redacted
- **Significance:** Nadia copied on email communications, indicating continued contact with Epstein's circle

### 2.6 "Talk to Nadia" Emails -- [EFTA02439416](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02439416.pdf) and [EFTA02439434](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02439434.pdf) (June 2009)
- **Type:** Email chain between Jeffrey Epstein and an unidentified young woman
- **Context:** A young woman writes to Epstein about performing at a show and needing $50 for dance materials. Later she discusses finding her passport and "diploma" (misspelled as "deploma"), and mentions her mother approving her going "down to work."
- **Epstein's instruction:** `talk to nadia`
- **Additional Epstein instruction:** `get 200 $ from bella call the office`
- **Significance:** Epstein directing a young woman to coordinate with Nadia. The context -- a young performer needing small amounts of cash, discussing travel for "work," needing a passport -- is consistent with the recruitment and trafficking pattern described by prosecutors. "Bella" likely refers to another member of the household staff.
- **Date:** June 2009 -- AFTER Epstein's 2008 conviction and during his work-release period

## SECTION 3: AVILOOP LLC -- MARCINKOVA'S COMPANY

### 3.1 Overview

Aviloop LLC was Marcinkova's aviation-related company. It appears in **18+ documents** across the redaction database:

| EFTA Number | Content |
|---|---|
| [EFTA01399653](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01399653.pdf) | Financial summary listing Aviloop LLC alongside "FT Real Estate" |
| [EFTA01481226](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01481226.pdf) | Banking document for AVILOOP LLC |
| [EFTA01525616](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01525616.pdf) | AVILOOP LLC (banking/financial) |
| [EFTA01525696](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01525696.pdf)-[EFTA01525991](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01525991.pdf) | Series of 10+ AVILOOP LLC banking documents |
| [EFTA01577223](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01577223.pdf)-[EFTA01577325](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01577325.pdf) | AVILOOP LLC checking account statements |
| [EFTA01656524](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01656524.pdf) | **SAR (Suspicious Activity Report)** -- Aviloop is "Subject 1 of 25" |
| [EFTA00020685](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00020685.pdf) | **Wire transfer records** -- $100,000 to Aviloop LLC |

### 3.2 Wire Transfers to Aviloop LLC (Critical Finding)

**Document: [EFTA00020685](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00020685.pdf)** -- SDNY production follow-up requesting wire transfer details from the Butterfly Trust Account at Deutsche Bank.

The OCR text reveals the following wire transfers from Epstein's **Butterfly Trust** account:

| Date | Recipient | Amount | Receiving Bank | Routing # |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 01/28/2015 | [Redacted] | $50,000 | JPMorgan | 49 999921 |
| 04/22/2015 | [Redacted] | $50,000 | JPMorgan | 49 999921 |
| 09/24/2015 | [Redacted] | $23,625.44 | JPMorgan | 99 999991 |
| **11/27/2018** | **Aviloop LLC** | **$45,000** | **TD Bank** | **JEGE LLC acct 42953475** |
| **11/30/2018** | **Aviloop LLC** | **$100,000** | **TD Bank** | **Butterfly Trust acct 44130552** |
| **12/03/2018** | [Redacted] | **$250,000** | **Bank of America** | **026009593** |

**UPDATE (2026-02-12):** DS9 wire transfer summaries ([EFTA00092643](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00092643.pdf)/[EFTA00105307](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00105307.pdf)) reveal an additional $45,000 wire from JEGE LLC to Aviloop on 11/27/2018 -- **one day BEFORE the Miami Herald series began.** Total Aviloop payments in late November 2018: **$145,000** (not $100,000 as originally reported).

**Timeline significance:** The Miami Herald's "Perversion of Justice" series began publishing on **November 28, 2018**. The $45,000 wire preceded the series by one day; the $100,000 wire followed two days later. The $250,000 wire to another individual followed on December 3, 2018. DS9 email correspondence ([EFTA01015397](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA01015397.pdf)) shows the $43,876 wire was discussed on November 26, 2018 (two days before the Herald series), with the label "I think it's Aviloop income." The Government cited this labeling in its detention memorandum as part of its argument for Epstein's detention.

This is exactly the payment pattern described in the Government's detention memorandum (see Section 4 below).

### 3.3 Suspicious Activity Report ([EFTA01656524](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01656524.pdf))

Aviloop LLC was listed as **Subject 1 of 25** in what appears to be a financial institution SAR filing. The 25 subjects include the full constellation of known Epstein-controlled entities:

1. **AVILOOP LLC** (Marcinkova)
2. (Missing/redacted)
3. **Butterfly Trust** (Epstein)
4. (Missing/redacted)
5. **DARREN K INDYKE PLLC** (Epstein's attorney)
6-7. (Redacted)
8. **HBRK ASSOCIATES INC** (Epstein accounting)
9. (Redacted)
10. **Hyperion Air LLC** (Epstein aviation)
11. **INDYKE** (Epstein's attorney again)
12. **JEGE LLC** (Epstein entity)
13. **JSC INTERIORS LLC** (Epstein entity)
14. (Redacted)
15. **KLEIN** (likely Klein Ltd, Epstein entity)
16. **LSJL LLC** (Epstein entity)
17-18. (Redacted)
19. **Neptune LLC** (Epstein entity)
20. **Plan D LLC** (Epstein entity)
21. **SAIPHLR** (Epstein entity)
22. **Southern Country International** (Epstein entity)
23. **Southern Financial LLC** (Epstein entity)
24. (Redacted - Southern ...)
25. **Zorro Management LLC** (Epstein's primary management company)

**Significance:** Aviloop LLC was treated by financial institutions as part of the same entity network as Epstein's known shell companies and trusts, confirming that Marcinkova's company was integrated into Epstein's financial structure.

### 3.4 Aviloop Banking Records

Multiple checking account statements ([EFTA01577223](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01577223.pdf)-[EFTA01577325](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01577325.pdf)) show Aviloop LLC held regular checking accounts. One document ([EFTA01577284](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01577284.pdf)) references an account notification about "We are eliminat[ing]..." suggesting potential account closure.

### 3.5 Bank Record Cross-Reference -- TD Bank Account

The bank record [EFTA01286686](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01286686.pdf) reveals a TD Bank account (number 4312480538) in the name of "NADIA," receiving funds from the "Money Trust" (an Epstein-controlled trust). The [EFTA00020685](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00020685.pdf) wire transfer document confirms that the $100,000 payment to Aviloop LLC on 11/30/2018 was routed through **TD Bank** (routing 011400071). This suggests Marcinkova's personal TD Bank account and the Aviloop LLC account were at the same institution, consistent with the entity being a personal vehicle for Marcinkova rather than an independent business.

## SECTION 4: PROSECUTION DOCUMENTS -- CO-CONSPIRATOR STATUS

### 4.1 SDNY Status Update -- Plea Negotiations ([EFTA00013209](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00013209.pdf) / [EFTA00018544](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00018544.pdf))

Two versions of an SDNY prosecution status memo (likely updates to senior DOJ officials) contain this critical passage:

> *"U.S. v. Maxwell, 20 Cr. 330 (AJN): This summer, we charged Ghislaine Maxwell with conspiring to entice minors to travel for the purpose of sexual abuse in connection with helping Jeffrey Epstein to abuse his many victims. The case focused on three specific victims that traveled to be abused by Epstein, including instances in which Maxwell herself participated in the acts of abuse. Trial is set for this coming July. We are finishing discovery, and motions are scheduled for December. [...] Relat[edly,] we are in plea negotiations with counsel for [REDACTED], another Epstein co-conspirator. [REDACTED], who scheduled hundreds of sexual massages with minors for Epstein but was also a victim of his sexual abuse, may plead to an obstruction of justice-related count."*

**Analysis:** The redacted name before "another Epstein co-conspirator" describes someone who:
- Scheduled "hundreds of sexual massages with minors" for Epstein
- Was "also a victim of his sexual abuse"
- Was in plea negotiations for "an obstruction of justice-related count"

**Identity assessment (revised 2026-02-13):** The redacted person's identity cannot be confirmed from the available documents. Two candidates exist:

- **Sarah Kellen** is the stronger match for the scheduling language. Plea draft documents in [EFTA00089268](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00089268.pdf) reference "hundreds of appointments," "dozens of minors," and "2-3/day" — closely matching the DAG memo's "hundreds of sexual massages." The scheduling role is consistently Kellen's primary documented function. Susan Necheles, who later represented Maxwell at trial, served as defense counsel for this co-conspirator.
- **Nadia Marcinkova** is a stronger match for the "also a victim" language, given her documented history of being brought from Yugoslavia as a minor and Epstein's control over her appearance and health. SDNY Human Trafficking Coordinators described the person under plea consideration as a "victim-participant" ([EFTA00024285](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00024285.pdf)), which is more consistent with Marcinkova's profile.

On balance, the plea draft evidence more strongly supports Kellen. Earlier versions of this report stated this "matches Nadia Marcinkova precisely," which was an overstatement given the ambiguity.

### 4.2 Detention Memorandum -- $100,000 Payment ([EFTA00014493](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00014493.pdf) / [EFTA00016748](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00016748.pdf))

The Government's supplemental letter to Judge Berman (July 16, 2019) in *United States v. Jeffrey Epstein, 19 Cr. 490 (RMB)*:

> *"Records from Institution-1 show that on or about November 30, 2018, or two days after the series in the Miami Herald began, the defendant wired $100,000 from a trust account he controlled to an individual named as a potential co-conspirator -- and for whom Epstein obtained protection in -- the NPA. This individual was also named and featured prominently in the Herald series."*

And on Page 2:

> *"[This individual was] also named as a potential co-conspirator -- and for whom Epstein also obtained protection in -- the NPA. This individual is also one of the employees identified in the Indictment, which alleges that she and two other identified employees facilitated the defendant's trafficking of minors by, among other things, contacting victims and scheduling their sexual encounters with the defendant at his residences in Manhattan and Palm Beach, Florida. This individual was also named and featured prominently in the Herald series."*

**Confirmed connection to [EFTA00020685](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00020685.pdf):** The wire transfer records prove this $100,000 payment went to **Aviloop LLC** at TD Bank on 11/30/2018. The Government described this as a payment to a co-conspirator protected under the NPA who was "one of the employees identified in the Indictment" and who "facilitated the defendant's trafficking of minors."

### 4.3 NPA Co-Conspirator Protection ([EFTA00014493](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00014493.pdf) / [EFTA00016748](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00016748.pdf) / [EFTA00027666](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00027666.pdf))

The NPA (Non-Prosecution Agreement) from 2007 explicitly protected Marcinkova and other co-conspirators. From [EFTA00027666](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00027666.pdf) (a detailed NPA analysis document):

> *"The NPA also provided that [the Government would] not institute any criminal charges against any potential co-conspirators of Epstein, including but not limited to [REDACTED]"*

This confirms Marcinkova was explicitly named in the NPA alongside other co-conspirators as protected from federal prosecution.

### 4.4 Additional Detention Memorandum ([EFTA00028785](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00028785.pdf))

> *"Records obtained by the Government from Institution-1 appear to show that just two days later, on or about November 30, 2018, the defendant wired $100,000 from a trust account he controlled to an individual named as a possible co-conspirator in the NPA. The same records appear to show that just three days after that, on or about December 3, 2018, the defendant wired $250,000 from the same trust account to another [individual]."*

This confirms the two-payment pattern: $100,000 to Aviloop LLC (Marcinkova) and $250,000 to another co-conspirator three days later.

### 4.5 London Investigation Travel ([EFTA00037448](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00037448.pdf))

An FBI travel request from March 2020:

> *"[Agents] are requesting travel to London, accompanied by [REDACTED], [and] expect to leave on the 17th and return on the 20th. The pu[rpose is an] offer of a witness/co-conspirator of Jeffrey Epstein's."*

This indicates the FBI traveled to London in March 2020 to meet with or obtain information from an Epstein co-conspirator/witness -- potentially related to Marcinkova or other named co-conspirators.

### 4.6 "Epstein Co-conspirator" Subject Line ([EFTA00037629](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00037629.pdf))

An FBI email with subject line "Epstein Co-conspirator pits" includes references to "Human Traffick[ing]" in the redacted text.

### 5.3 Notable Flight Companions

**Prince Andrew** -- Marcinkova flew on the same Epstein aircraft as Prince Andrew on October 16 and 17, 2004. This is corroborated by the separate SDNY mutual legal assistance request ([EFTA00022062](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00022062.pdf)) seeking to interview Prince Andrew about "females Epstein or his associates arranged for [him] to meet."

**Jean-Luc Brunel** -- Brunel, the French modeling agent later charged with sex trafficking (found dead in prison in 2022), shared 11 flights with Marcinkova between January 2004 and February 2005.

**Sarah Kellen** -- Kellen (now Sarah Kensington), another named co-conspirator in the NPA, shared 77 flights with Marcinkova. Kellen was also described as scheduling abuse sessions.

**Glenn and Eva Dubin** -- The Dubins, prominent financiers, shared 5 flights each with Marcinkova.

### 5.4 Eastern European Female Companions

Several other Eastern European women appear as Marcinkova's flight companions:
- **Natalya Malyshov** -- 2 flights (Jun-Sep 2004)
- **Adriana Mucinska** -- 7 flights (Dec 2004-Nov 2005)
- **Tatiana Kovylina** -- 2 flights (Nov 2005)
- **Zina Broukis** -- 2 flights (Jan 2005)
- **Aline Weber** -- 4 flights (Feb 2004)

This pattern of young Eastern European women traveling on Epstein's aircraft with Marcinkova is consistent with allegations that Marcinkova was both a victim and later served as a recruiter.

### 5.5 Flight Date Range Analysis

Marcinkova's documented flights span from **September 22, 2003 to January 19, 2006** -- a period of approximately 2.3 years. With 124 flights in this period, she averaged roughly one flight every 7 days. She was essentially a permanent fixture on Epstein's aircraft during this period, consistent with accounts that she lived in his residences.

## SECTION 6: KNOWLEDGE GRAPH -- FORMAL CLASSIFICATION

### 6.1 Entity Classification

The knowledge graph classifies Nadia Marcinkova (entity 11) as:
- **Person type:** `enabler`
- **Occupation:** `Assistant`
- **Public figure:** `true`
- **Legal status:** `no_action`

The classification of "no_action" for legal status, combined with the "enabler" designation, reflects her unique dual status as both victim and co-conspirator who was protected under the NPA.

### 6.2 Relationships

The knowledge graph records two formal relationships for entity 11 (Nadia Marcinkova):

**1. victim_of (relationship 1468):**
- Source: Anonymous Victim
- Target: Nadia Marcinkova
- Metadata: `abuse_type: sexual_contact; corroborated: true; corroboration_details: "Multiple victim testimonies. Source: EFTA02731082"; legal_outcome: "Non-prosecution agreement"; notes: "Participated in abuse as directed by Epstein; also described as a victim herself"`

**2. employed_by (relationship 1481):**
- Source: Jeffrey Epstein
- Target: Nadia Marcinkova
- Metadata: `notes: "Marcinkova participated in abuse directed by Epstein. Non-prosecution agreement"`

### 6.3 Source Document -- [EFTA02731082](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2012/EFTA02731082.pdf)

The victim testimony document ([EFTA02731082](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2012/EFTA02731082.pdf)) referenced in the knowledge graph contains heavily redacted victim interview notes from SDNY meetings in 2019. Fragments visible include:
- References to meetings "On August 27, 2019, we met with [REDACTED] in New York"
- Descriptions of "sexualized massages" at Epstein's "Palm Beach" residence
- Payments of "$200" and "$300" to victims
- A woman "who was an adult" present during interactions
- Maxwell approaching a victim "outside at a picnic table with her [family]" claiming "he gives scholarships"
- References to victims being "14 years old" and events occurring "in the fall after turning [15/16]"

## SECTION 7: FINANCIAL STRUCTURE

### 7.1 Epstein's Entity Network

Aviloop LLC was embedded within Epstein's extensive financial structure. Bank balance documents ([EFTA01381149](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01381149.pdf), [EFTA01430750](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01430750.pdf), [EFTA01431991](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01431991.pdf)) reveal the following Epstein-controlled entities held accounts at the same institution (Deutsche Bank):

| Entity | Category | Sample Balance |
|---|---|---|
| Jeffrey Epstein (personal) | N | $1,243,515.74 - $4,378,298.11 |

| Gratitude America Ltd | M/N | $268,350 - $2,075,025 |
| HBRK Associates Inc | D | $149,498 - $211,289 |

### 7.2 Butterfly Trust as Payment Vehicle

The Butterfly Trust was the specific entity from which Epstein's suspicious post-Herald payments were made:
- **$100,000 to Aviloop LLC** (Marcinkova) on 11/30/2018
- **$250,000 to [Redacted]** on 12/03/2018
- Earlier payments of $50,000 (Jan 2015, Apr 2015) and $23,625 (Sep 2015) to other recipients at JPMorgan

The Butterfly Trust maintained balances of $323,679-$733,701 during the 2018 period and was managed by Deutsche Bank under account officers Jj Litchford and Paul Morris ([EFTA01359500](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01359500.pdf)).

### 7.3 Aviation Connections

Marcinkova's aviation interests connect to Epstein's broader aircraft operations:
- **Aviloop LLC** -- Marcinkova's company, included in SAR filing alongside Epstein entities
- **Hyperion Air LLC** -- Epstein's helicopter company (Sikorsky S-76C, formerly "Air Ghislaine Inc")
- **Air Ghislaine Inc** -- Originally registered to Maxwell; renamed Shmitka Air Inc in Feb 2010; later became Freedom Air International Inc
- **N493LX** -- Raytheon/Beechjet 400A aircraft, previously owned by Flight Options LLC, with connections to Air Ghislaine Inc

Marcinkova later became a licensed pilot and founded "Global Girl Inc" and "Aviloop LLC" -- entities that may have been partially funded through Epstein's financial network.

---

## SECTION 9: THE PRINCE ANDREW CONNECTION

### 9.1 Flight Overlap

Marcinkova was on the same flights as Prince Andrew on **October 16-17, 2004**. The knowledge graph records 2 shared flights.

### 9.2 SDNY Request to Interview Prince Andrew ([EFTA00022062](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00022062.pdf))

A formal mutual legal assistance request (April 3, 2020) from the U.S. Central Authority to the U.K. Central Authority sought to interview Prince Andrew regarding:
- "Females Epstein or his associates or representatives, including Maxwell, arranged for Prince Andrew to meet"
- "Females Epstein or his associates arranged for other adult men to meet"
- "Massage, massages, and/or masseuses"
- "Any sexual encounters and/or romantic relationships involving Prince Andrew and any female he met through Maxwell and/or Epstein"

The document notes:
> *"There is evidence that Prince Andrew engaged in sexual conduct involving one of Epstein's victims. Prince Andrew is not presently a target of the investigation, and U.S. authorities have not, to date, gathered evidence that he has committed any crime under U.S. law."*

## SECTION 11: KEY FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

### Finding 1: Selective Identity Redaction (Revised 2026-02-12)
Marcinkova's full name is absent from 1.8 million redaction records and 38,955 OCR records in the internal FBI databases (DS8/DS10/DS12). However, the full-text corpus contains 200+ documents with her name in court filings, NPA drafts, civil litigation, and FBI intelligence reports (DS9/DS11). The original characterization of "systematic identity suppression" was accurate for the redaction databases but overstated for the file collection as a whole. The correct characterization is that her name was selectively redacted in internal FBI materials while remaining visible in publicly-filed court documents.

### Finding 2: Dual Victim/Co-Conspirator Status Confirmed
The knowledge graph and prosecution documents confirm Marcinkova's dual status as both a victim of Epstein's abuse (corroborated by multiple victim testimonies) and an active co-conspirator. The DAG meeting memo ([EFTA00013209](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00013209.pdf)) describes one redacted co-conspirator "who scheduled hundreds of sexual massages with minors for Epstein but was also a victim of his sexual abuse" — the scheduling language more closely matches Kellen's documented role, though Marcinkova cannot be excluded (see Section 4.1). Regardless of which individual is named in the DAG memo, Marcinkova's dual victim/co-conspirator status is independently confirmed by multiple prosecution documents.

### Finding 3: Suspicious Payment Timing Around Miami Herald Series (Updated 2026-02-12)
DS9 reveals the total Aviloop payments in late November 2018 were **$145,000** (not $100,000): $45,000 from JEGE LLC on 11/27/2018 and $100,000 from Butterfly Trust on 11/30/2018. Email correspondence labels one payment as "Aviloop income" ([EFTA01015397](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA01015397.pdf): "I think it's Aviloop income"). The Government cited these payments in its detention memorandum as evidence of potential obstruction, noting the timing relative to the Miami Herald series. Combined with regular financial flows from the "Money Trust" through Marcinkova's TD Bank account, the documents show an ongoing financial relationship that persisted long after the 2007 NPA. Whether these specific payments were routine business transactions or had another purpose is not established in the released documents.

### Finding 4: NPA Explicitly Protected Marcinkova from Prosecution
Government filings confirm Marcinkova was "named as a potential co-conspirator -- and for whom Epstein obtained protection in -- the NPA" ([EFTA00014493](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00014493.pdf)). The NPA additionally provided that the USAO "will not request, initiate, or in any way encourage immigration authorities to institute immigration proceedings against Ross or Marcinkova" ([EFTA00176610](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00176610.pdf)). She received immunity from federal prosecution and immigration proceedings under the controversial 2007 agreement.

### Finding 5: Post-NPA Obstruction Plea Negotiations
By late 2020, SDNY was in "plea negotiations" with counsel for one redacted co-conspirator for "an obstruction of justice-related count" ([EFTA00013209](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00013209.pdf)). The individual's identity is redacted; plea draft evidence ([EFTA00089268](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00089268.pdf)) more closely matches Sarah Kellen (see Section 4.1). If Marcinkova, this would indicate her NPA protection did not extend to post-NPA conduct. The plea negotiations collapsed regardless.

### Finding 6: Flight Log Connections to High-Profile Individuals
Marcinkova's 124 flights with Epstein included shared flights with Prince Andrew (2 flights, October 2004), Jean-Luc Brunel (11 flights), Ghislaine Maxwell (20 flights), and Glenn and Eva Dubin (5 flights each). These connections place Marcinkova at the intersection of Epstein's social, criminal, and financial networks.

### Finding 7: Aviation Entity Integration
Aviloop LLC was treated by financial institutions as part of the Epstein entity network, appearing in a SAR alongside 24 other Epstein-controlled companies and trusts. This suggests Marcinkova's ostensibly independent business was functionally part of Epstein's financial structure.

---

## SECTION 12: DS9/DS11 EVIDENCE (Added 2026-02-12)

The following findings are from a full-text corpus revisit. They substantially expand the evidentiary record from approximately 30 EFTA documents to over 230.

### 12.1 FBI I-914 Trafficking Victim Certification ([EFTA00156551](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00156551.pdf))

The FBI formally certified Marcinkova as a "victim of a severe form of trafficking in persons" for T-visa purposes. Investigation dates: 12/06/2018 - 06/28/2022. Statutes cited: 18 USC 371 (conspiracy), 1591(a),(b) (sex trafficking), 1623 (perjury/false declarations), 2423(a) (transportation of minors), NYPL 130.55 (sexual abuse third degree). The victimization description: "Applicant was recruited, harbored, and obtained by Jeffrey Epstein and others for purposes of a coercive sexual relationship." She cooperated with the investigation.

### 12.2 $10 Million Trust Annuity ([EFTA00098341](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00098341.pdf))

Epstein's January 2019 Trust (six months before arrest) names Marcinkova as recipient of a $10,000,000 annuity -- the second-highest individual bequest after a $100M+$20M beneficiary. This makes her one of the top 4 individual beneficiaries of Epstein's estate.

### 12.3 Full NPA Text with Immigration Waiver ([EFTA00176610](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00176610.pdf))

Multiple versions of the NPA name "Sarah Kellen, Adriana Ross, Lesley Groff, and Nadia Marcinkova" as protected co-conspirators. The NPA explicitly states the government "will not request, initiate, or in any way encourage immigration authorities to institute immigration proceedings against Ross or Marcinkova." Ross and Marcinkova were the only two individuals singled out for immigration protection.

### 12.4 FBI Tactical Intelligence Report ([EFTA00261437](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00261437.pdf))

Complete intelligence dossier: Slovak citizenship, 4 Alien Flight School Program applications (2012-2017), 4 visa applications (2011-2019), Aviloop LLC (DUNS 96-834-7414, 1 employee, $97,000 annual sales). The address "Stanley, NM 87506" (2004-2009) is near Zorro Ranch, confirming Marcinkova lived at or near Epstein's New Mexico property. Most recent visa application: March 26, 2019 -- four months before Epstein's arrest.

### 12.5 Aircraft Brokerage Agreement ([EFTA00797507](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00797507.pdf))

Aviloop LLC was formally engaged as broker to sell JEGE LLC's Gulfstream G-IV (N120JE) for $3,100,000 with a $100,000 broker fee, effective August 1, 2018.

### 12.6 JPMorgan and TD Bank Accounts

Aviloop LLC had a JPMorgan Chase business checking account (JPM-SDNY-00054770) produced alongside all Epstein/Maxwell accounts in the grand jury subpoena response ([EFTA00096342](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00096342.pdf)). SDNY formally requested TD Bank preserve both Butterfly Trust and Aviloop LLC accounts in October 2019 ([EFTA00097221](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00097221.pdf)). PayPal/Venmo records were also subpoenaed for "Marcinko" alongside Maxwell in September 2019 ([EFTA00151227](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00151227.pdf)).

### 12.7 Aviloop as Visa Fraud Vehicle

Multiple emails (2011-2018) demonstrate Aviloop's primary purpose was to provide the appearance of legitimate income for Marcinkova's visa applications:

- "It is less important how it is billed than the fact it shows up asap in Aviloop account, so I can take further steps to divide it between the accounts to satisfy all visa requirements" ([EFTA00678472](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00678472.pdf), Aug 2013)
- Epstein: "Do you want me to send aviloop money, booked as what" ([EFTA00966117](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00966117.pdf), Aug 2013)
- "Aviloop. As payment for services, to show income for the visa" ([EFTA00966384](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00966384.pdf), Aug 2013)
- "Most of the money wired in 2011 was used for Aviloop and my visa" ([EFTA00877198](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00877198.pdf), Jun 2012)
- "I think it's Aviloop income" -- wire labeling 2 days before Herald ([EFTA01015397](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA01015397.pdf), Nov 2018)

### 12.8 Victim Testimony ([EFTA00083816](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00083816.pdf))

Laura Newman's December 2020 FBI interview identifies "NADIA MARCINKO (the NADIA she spoke about earlier), SARAH KELLEN, LESLIE, BELLA" by name. Newman described her as "tall blonde... his main NADIA." Multiple victims in civil RICO filings ([EFTA00222648](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00222648.pdf)) were "made to perform sex acts on Nadia Marcinkova in Epstein's presence."

### 12.9 Epstein Redirected Aircraft to Prevent Target Letter Service ([EFTA00081180](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00081180.pdf))

Court filings describe Epstein redirecting his aircraft from Teterboro to USVI to prevent FBI agents from serving Marcinkova with a target letter. This indicates that Marcinkova was a target (not merely a witness) of the FBI investigation, and that Epstein took active steps to obstruct service of the letter.
