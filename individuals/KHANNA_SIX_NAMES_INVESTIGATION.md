# THE SIX REDACTED CO-CONSPIRATORS: INVESTIGATION OF NAMES READ BY REP. RO KHANNA ON THE HOUSE FLOOR

## Classification: Investigative Analysis of DOJ Epstein Files
## Date: February 10, 2026
## Context: On February 10, 2026, Rep. Ro Khanna (D-CA) read onto the House floor the names of six men identified as potential co-conspirators in the Jeffrey Epstein case, which had been redacted by the FBI in publicly released documents. Rep. Thomas Massie (R-KY) joined in the disclosure. The names were read under the Speech and Debate Clause of the U.S. Constitution.

# EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Six names were disclosed:

| # | Name | Known Identity | Evidence in EFTA Files | Co-Conspirator Basis |
|---|------|---------------|----------------------|---------------------|
| 1 | **Salvatore Nuara** | NYPD detective; disciplined for escort service connection | 0 hits across 1.38M documents (full corpus); **confirmed on [EFTA00077895](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00077895.pdf) list (#3)** | NYPD complaint source, 2010 |
| 2 | **Zurab Mikeladze** | Georgian oil/business figure | 0 hits across 1.38M documents (full corpus); **confirmed on [EFTA00077895](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00077895.pdf) list (#10)** | NYPD complaint source, 2021 |
| 3 | **Leonic Leonov** | Little publicly known | 0 hits across 1.38M documents (full corpus); **confirmed on [EFTA00077895](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00077895.pdf) list (#14)** | NYPD complaint source, 2021 |
| 4 | **Nicola Caputo** | Former EU Parliament member (Italy) | 0 hits for "Nicola Caputo" across 1.38M documents; **confirmed on [EFTA00077895](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00077895.pdf) list (#17)** | NYPD complaint source, 2009 |
| 5 | **Sultan Ahmed bin Sulayem** | Chairman/CEO of DP World (Dubai) | **5,026 documents** across full corpus (updated Feb 12, 2026; 2,292 in DS9), 10-year relationship (2009-2019), victim testimony, port infrastructure access, seized CD evidence | Extensive — see [DUBAI_SULAYEM_INVESTIGATION.md](/individuals/DUBAI_SULAYEM_INVESTIGATION.md) |
| 6 | **Leslie Wexner** | Billionaire founder of L Brands/Victoria's Secret | **1,497 documents** across full corpus (updated Feb 12, 2026; 675 in DS9), FBI FD-302 victim statement of direct abuse, FBI "secondary co-conspirator" designation, 2007 Cordero v. VS/Wexner civil suit | Extensive — FBI witness statement, $100M+ misappropriation, Victoria's Secret pipeline |

**Key finding**: Four of the six names (Nuara, Mikeladze, Leonov, Caputo) produce **zero results across the full 1,380,937-document corpus** (2,731,796 pages -- confirmed Feb 12, 2026 against expanded corpus nearly 3x the original). These names exist ONLY on the [EFTA00077895](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00077895.pdf) co-conspirator list — they are genuinely absent from every other released document. By contrast, Wexner appears in **1,497 documents** and Sulayem in **5,026 documents**. The four lesser-known names' designation as "potential co-conspirators" traces to NYPD complaint filings spanning 2009-2021.

**Critical new context from web research (Feb 10, 2026)**:
- These six names come from a **20-person co-conspirator list** in the Epstein files. Initially only Epstein and Maxwell were visible; 16 additional names have now been unredacted. **Two names remain redacted.**
- The FBI designated Wexner as a **"SECONDARY CO-CONSPIRATOR"** in a document dated August 15, 2019 ([EFTA00175080](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00175080.pdf) — Dataset 9, now downloaded and verified)
- The DOJ released **4,800 messages** between Sultan bin Sulayem and Epstein
- **Wexner is scheduled for deposition before the House Oversight Committee on February 16, 2026**
- Deputy AG Todd Blanche acknowledged the redactions were an error and ordered them unredacted

**The full 20-person list** has been verified from the source document [EFTA00077895](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00077895.pdf) — see §7 for the complete table with all names, sources, and dates. Two entries (#5 and #13) remain redacted.

**NOTE**: Rep. Khanna stated the DOJ "blanket-redacted anyone who was a female." The list contains 12 female names — these may be victims who filed NYPD complaints, witnesses, or facilitators.

# SECTION 1: THE NON-PROSECUTION AGREEMENT CO-CONSPIRATOR CLAUSE

## 1.1 The Legal Framework

The 2008 Non-Prosecution Agreement (NPA) between AUSA Alexander Acosta and Epstein's legal team contained a clause documented in [EFTA00027666](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00027666.pdf) (the CVRA judicial opinion):

> The government agreed "not [to] institute any criminal charges against any potential co-conspirators of Epstein, including but not limited to [REDACTED]"

This clause protected not just Epstein but **all named co-conspirators** from federal prosecution. The names following "including but not limited to" were redacted in the public release. These are likely the names Khanna read on the House floor.

## 1.2 The FBI's July 2019 Co-Conspirator Outreach

[EFTA00037366](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00037366.pdf) — dated July 7, 2019 (5 days after Epstein's arrest) — documents FBI agents making contact with co-conspirators:

> "We made contact with [REDACTED] last night in NY. Contact was made with [REDACTED]. Attempts were made to [REDACTED] and Brunel. [REDACTED] is confirmed to live in NY but was away for the holiday weekend."

This suggests that when Epstein was arrested, the FBI immediately began contacting the individuals named in the NPA. Jean Luc Brunel is the only unredacted name.

## 1.3 The 86-Page Prosecution Memo

[EFTA02731082](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2012/EFTA02731082.pdf) — titled "Investigation into Potential Co-Conspirators of Jeffrey Epstein" — is an 86-page memorandum from AUSAs to U.S. Attorney Geoffrey Berman dated December 19, 2019. This is the definitive document on the co-conspirator investigation. It contains 45 references to Wexner, 1 reference to "a sultan in Dubai," and **zero** references to Nuara, Mikeladze, Leonov, or Caputo.

**This means**: The four lesser-known names were likely in the original 2008 NPA co-conspirator list but were NOT subjects of the 2019 SDNY investigation. Wexner and Sultan bin Sulayem were investigated in 2019 but not charged.

---

# SECTION 2: INDIVIDUAL PROFILES

## 2.1 SALVATORE NUARA

### Public Identity
- **Occupation**: NYPD detective
- **Notable**: Disciplined by the NYPD in connection with an escort service; his name appeared in Jeffrey Epstein's "black book" of contacts

### Evidence in EFTA Files
**0 results across full 1,380,937-document corpus** (2,731,796 pages -- updated Feb 12, 2026):
- "Nuara": 0 results (one false positive from garbled OCR in [EFTA01273824](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01273824.pdf) — a financial statement, not a name match)
- "Salvatore Nuara": 0 exact matches
- Image analysis database (21,859 images): 0 results
- **CONFIRMED** on [EFTA00077895](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00077895.pdf) co-conspirator list as **#3**, source: NYPD 2010

### Broader Search
- "Salvatore" returns 3 hits, all for "Salvatore Moore" (Deutsche Bank employee) — no connection to Nuara
- NYPD references appear in 20+ documents ([EFTA00015037](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00015037.pdf), [EFTA00019022](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00019022.pdf), [EFTA00028415](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00028415.pdf), etc.) but none mention Nuara by name
- [EFTA00029444](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00029444.pdf) contains an NYPD email "PICARELLO, JOSEPH" — a different NYPD officer involved in Epstein sex offender monitoring

### Assessment
Nuara was likely named in Epstein's black book (the physical contact book seized in 2005, not the same as the publicly leaked "Little Black Book"). His NYPD connection and escort service discipline may have placed him in the co-conspirator orbit during the original 2006-2008 Palm Beach investigation. The fact that he does not appear in the 2019 SDNY prosecution memo suggests he was not a focus of the later investigation.

## 2.2 ZURAB MIKELADZE

### Public Identity
- **Nationality**: Georgian
- **Industry**: Oil/energy sector
- **Limited public profile**; LinkedIn presence suggests oil industry connections in Georgia/CIS region

### Evidence in EFTA Files
**0 results across full 1,380,937-document corpus** (2,731,796 pages -- updated Feb 12, 2026):
- "Mikeladze": 0 results
- "Zurab": 0 results
- "Georgia" + "oil": 0 relevant results
- "Tbilisi": 0 results
- **CONFIRMED** on [EFTA00077895](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00077895.pdf) co-conspirator list as **#10**, source: NYPD 2021

### Assessment
Mikeladze's presence on a co-conspirator list derived from NYPD complaints does not, by itself, establish the nature of his connection to Epstein. The NYPD 2021 source date is notably late — this may represent a complaint filed after the 2019 arrest/death, possibly by a victim who came forward during the SDNY investigation. His complete absence from the full 1.38M-document corpus means he exists only on the [EFTA00077895](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00077895.pdf) co-conspirator list, and no details about the NYPD complaint that generated this entry are available in the released files.

---

## 2.3 LEONIC LEONOV

### Public Identity
- **Extremely limited publicly available information**
- Name is consistent with Russian/Eastern European origin
- No confirmed biographical details from public reporting

### Evidence in EFTA Files
**0 results across full 1,380,937-document corpus** (2,731,796 pages -- updated Feb 12, 2026):
- "Leonov": 0 results
- "Leonic": 0 results
- **CONFIRMED** on [EFTA00077895](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00077895.pdf) co-conspirator list as **#14**, source: NYPD 2021

### Assessment
This is the most opaque of the six names. No public biographical information has been identified. Like Mikeladze, the NYPD 2021 source date suggests a post-arrest complaint. His complete absence from the full 1.38M-document corpus means he exists only on the [EFTA00077895](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00077895.pdf) co-conspirator list, and no details about the underlying NYPD complaint are available.

---

## 2.4 NICOLA CAPUTO

### Public Identity
- **Former member of the European Parliament** representing Italy
- Political career in Italian and European politics

### Evidence in EFTA Files
**0 results for "Nicola Caputo" across full 1,380,937-document corpus** (2,731,796 pages -- updated Feb 12, 2026):
- "Caputo" returns 18+ hits — all for **Kate Caputo** (Leon Black's assistant, toured Google with Epstein on March 21, 2013 — see [EFTA02143198](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02143198.pdf)), **Christina Caputo** (PR associate — [EFTA01989928](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01989928.pdf)), or **Michael A. Caputo** ([EFTA00017751](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00017751.pdf) — government attorney, not related)
- **CONFIRMED** on [EFTA00077895](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00077895.pdf) co-conspirator list as **#17**, source: NYPD 2009 (now downloaded from Dataset 9)

### Key Context
[EFTA00077895](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00077895.pdf) has been downloaded and verified — it is a 21-page UNCLASSIFIED//FOUO document containing the complete 20-person co-conspirator list. Caputo appears as #17 with an NYPD 2009 complaint source. The NYPD 2009 date predates Epstein's 2019 SDNY arrest, placing it during or shortly after the original Florida case.

### Assessment
Like the other lesser-known names, no details about the underlying NYPD complaint are available, and no EFTA documents beyond the co-conspirator list reference Caputo.

## 2.5 SULTAN AHMED BIN SULAYEM

### Public Identity
- **Chairman and Group CEO of DP World** — the world's largest port operator, headquartered in Dubai
- Previously chairman of Dubai Customs and CEO of Nakheel (Dubai's megaproject developer including Palm Jumeirah)
- Access to Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, ruler of Dubai

### Evidence in EFTA Files — EXTENSIVE (40+ Documents)

Epstein forwards to Kellerhals: "See you Tomorrow at 10."
  - This documents a commercial port discussion between DP World and Epstein's USVI attorney. No evidence in the released documents connects this port inquiry to any illegal activity
  - **Kellerhals received $23 million from Epstein** ([EFTA00027019](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00027019.pdf)) — she was not just a local attorney but a major financial recipient

**Tom Barrack Connection**:
- [EFTA02418502](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02418502.pdf): Oct 2010 — Barrack (later indicted on charges of acting as an unregistered foreign agent for the UAE but acquitted on all counts in November 2022) writes to Epstein from Dubai: "will you see sultan?" — then adds: "U and I need to talk about Nicole!!!!" Barrack also describes Sultan as "in exile — quite sad!!!" (referencing the Dubai World financial crisis that had stripped Sultan of some roles)

- [EFTA01853867](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01853867.pdf): **"Girls" cancelled by Djibouti president (Sept 2011)** — Epstein to Sulayem: "our djibouti friend was a lot of fun, he canceled the girls he had coming, im not sure why?"
- [EFTA01866719](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01866719.pdf): Sulayem to Epstein (May 2011): **"Do you have the e mail for the Australian girl"**
- [EFTA01964576](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01964576.pdf): **Prince Andrew at DP World port opening** — Sulayem tells Epstein about "the presence of sheikh Mohammed and possibly the queen and Cameron."

- [EFTA00666117](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00666117.pdf): Sulayem-Epstein casual email (June 2016) — "I am coming with my girlfriend, my cook"
- **GPS tracking sneakers for children** (2011): Sulayem emailed Epstein about sneakers with GPS for monitoring children ("Gps GTX Smart Shoe"). Epstein responded: "thanks, great idea, i really like your friend."
- **Sexual discussions**: Sulayem described receiving massages in Japan and referenced women from Ukraine and Moldova. Sent Epstein links to websites facilitating transactional sexual arrangements.
- **Carbyne investment**: Both invested in Israeli cybersecurity firm Carbyne; discussed applications for "Dubai 911" and port security
- **Israel-UAE diplomacy**: Epstein acted as informal bridge between Israel and UAE through Sulayem before the Abraham Accords

**5,026 documents** reference Sulayem across the full 1.38M-document corpus (updated Feb 12, 2026; expanded from 1,379 in original report; 2,292 in DS9). **4,800 messages** between Sultan bin Sulayem and Epstein have been released by the DOJ.

**[Added Feb 12, 2026 -- New DS9 Sulayem Findings]:**
- [EFTA00317396](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00317396.pdf): Official DP World letterhead invitation from Group CEO Mohammed Sharaf to Epstein for the Maritime Hall of Fame Awards honoring Sulayem (May 9, 2012) -- demonstrates corporate-level awareness of the relationship

**Key reporting**: Bloomberg, Drop Site News, Middle East Eye, Newsweek, New Republic (see Sources section)

### Assessment
Sultan bin Sulayem is the most extensively documented of the six names in the EFTA files. The documents show a decade-long relationship (2009-2019) involving direct communications, at least one documented visit to Epstein's island, financial transactions, victim testimony naming "a guy from Dubai — Sultan," a commercial port inquiry in the USVI, and connections to high-level Gulf officials. Sultan has not been charged with any crime in connection with the Epstein case. Rep. Massie identified him as the one "pretty high up in foreign government." See [DUBAI_SULAYEM_INVESTIGATION.md](/individuals/DUBAI_SULAYEM_INVESTIGATION.md) for the complete analysis.

## 2.6 LESLIE WEXNER

### Public Identity
- **Billionaire founder of L Brands** (parent of Victoria's Secret, Bath & Body Works)
- **Net worth**: ~$5 billion
- Based in Columbus, Ohio (New Albany compound)
- **FBI "Prominent Names" briefing**: Listed with notation that Epstein "earned his money from Wexner"
- Known as Epstein's primary financial benefactor and the source of his wealth

### Evidence in EFTA Files — EXTENSIVE (1,497 documents across full corpus -- updated Feb 12, 2026; 675 in DS9)

**[Added Feb 12, 2026 -- New DS9 Wexner Findings]:**
- [EFTA00730295](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00730295.pdf): **Cordero v. Epstein/Victoria's Secret/Wexner** -- a 2007 civil action (SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, Index No. 113903/07) in which a victim sued Wexner personally AND "VICTORIA'S SECRET STORES BRAND MANAGEMENT, INC." as defendants. Case was settled (stipulation of discontinuance). This predates the 2008 NPA.
- [EFTA00143419](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00143419.pdf): Maxwell proffer -- cooperating witness stated: "Maxwell said that the 'modeling book' was used to recruit models for Victoria Secret which was one of the businesses of Les Wexner, another person close to Epstein."
- [EFTA00146704](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00146704.pdf): Victim letter describing the trafficking pipeline: "She was told that she would get a modelling contract through Karen Models, owned and run by Jean Luc Brunel and financed by Epstein, to work as a model for Les Wexner's Victoria's Secret."
- [EFTA00078311](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00078311.pdf): Civil complaint (filed 11/12/19) -- victim trafficked at age 16, describing "only one entrance with a guard house to Wexner's estate" in Ohio

#### A. The Prosecution Memo ([EFTA02731082](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2012/EFTA02731082.pdf))

The 86-page "Investigation into Potential Co-Conspirators" memo contains 45 references to Wexner. Key revelations from the Wexner section (pages 65-67):

**The Attorney Proffer (July 25, 2019)**:
> "Wexner is the billionaire founder and CEO of L Brands (formerly Limited Brands) corporation, which controls Victoria's Secret, among other retail brands."

**The Theft**:
> "Epstein stole or otherwise misappropriated several hundred million dollars from Wexner. That misconduct, together with fees that Epstein paid himself for his services to Wexner, appears to account for virtually all of Epstein's wealth."

**The Property Fraud**:
> "Epstein also sold himself a private plane that previously belonged to Wexner at a deeply discounted price."
> "Epstein frequently bought property on behalf of the Wexners and then sold it to himself for a fraction of the cost."

This includes the **9 East 71st Street townhouse** — Epstein's infamous Manhattan mansion — which was originally Wexner's property. Wexner's family "moved out of it in 1995" and Epstein occupied it thereafter.

**The Coverup**:
> "Epstein told Wexner that he was having legal problems involving an overly aggressive police chief and some sort of massage. Epstein said he was being blackmailed and it could get messy, so it would be best for Wexner's wife to take over the family finances."

**The Settlement**:
> "The Wexners did not want to bring unnecessary public attention to the issue, so they withdrew the power of attorney, and hired counsel to negotiate a private settlement with Epstein. As a result of those negotiations, Epstein agreed to return $100 million to the Wexners, which he did in January of 2008."

**The Denial**:
> "Wexner's attorneys indicated that Wexner had no knowledge of any inappropriate or unlawful activity with young women by Epstein."
> "Wexner knows nothing about the [REDACTED] claim from [REDACTED]"

**The Victoria's Secret Holding Out**:
> "At some point, Wexner heard a rumor that Epstein might be holding himself out as connected to Victoria's Secret, but when Wexner asked Epstein about it, Epstein denied doing so."

This denial is directly contradicted by victim testimony, including:
- [EFTA02491935](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02491935.pdf): Victim testified "becoming a mistress was the only job proposition" after being lured with Victoria's Secret modeling promises
- [EFTA01728258](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01728258.pdf): MC2 website advertised recruitment of girls "Age: Between 13 and 20 years old"
- Multiple victim statements describe being recruited with promises of Victoria's Secret modeling careers

#### B. FBI "Prominent Names" Briefing ([EFTA01660622](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01660622.pdf))

Page 17 of the FBI's master briefing document lists Wexner under "PROMINENT NAMES" with the entry:
> "[Epstein] earned his money from Wexner."

The same page lists Wexner alongside Trump, Weinstein, Prince Andrew, Staley, Black, Dubin, Dershowitz, and Clinton — the FBI's compilation of named individuals with substantiated or alleged connections to Epstein's abuse.

#### C. The Wexner Investigation File ([EFTA00025533](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00025533.pdf))

A standalone document captioned:
> "CONFIDENTIAL — Case Caption/Matter Description: **Wexner: Epstein investigation** — Russell cleared to participate"

This confirms a dedicated investigation into the Wexner-Epstein relationship existed within the DOJ.

#### D. FBI Photo Request ([EFTA00037790](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00037790.pdf))

FBI requested photographs of: "Ghislaine Maxwell, Juan Alessi, [REDACTED], **Leslie Wexner, JE (Ohio)**"

The specific request for a photo of Wexner with Epstein in Ohio indicates the investigation extended to their Ohio relationship and the New Albany compound.

#### E. Physical Evidence ([EFTA00007654](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%203/EFTA00007654.pdf))

Seized fax cover sheet: **"For: Mr. Wexner / From: Mr. Epstein"** — physical documentation of the direct business relationship.

#### F. Financial Forensics

From [EFTA00027019](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00027019.pdf) and related financial exhibits:
- Epstein's wealth originated almost entirely from Wexner, per the prosecution memo
- The prosecution memo states that Epstein's theft "appears to account for virtually all of Epstein's wealth" — meaning Wexner was the original source of funds that Epstein later deployed across his financial network. Whether Wexner had any knowledge of how those funds were ultimately used is disputed (his attorneys denied all knowledge)
- The $100M returned in Jan 2008 was a fraction of what was misappropriated, per Wexner's attorneys

#### G. The $46M Charitable Donation ([EFTA00026723](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00026723.pdf))

News article in SDNY files:
> "Jeffrey Epstein used $46 million charitable donation to keep alive his ties with billionaire Les Wexner"

Even after the 2007 split, Epstein maintained a financial connection to Wexner through a $46M donation to the Wexners' nonprofit. The nature and purpose of this donation have not been publicly explained.

#### H. The Victoria's Secret Pipeline

The prosecution memo confirms Epstein "had no formal role in L Brands or Victoria's Secret" but victim testimony establishes that Victoria's Secret was used as a recruitment tool:
- Victims were promised modeling careers
- MC2 Model Management (run by Jean Luc Brunel, protected under the NPA) operated as a feeder agency
- The Victoria's Secret brand served as bait for young women entering Epstein's orbit

#### I. The Victim Journal Reference ([EFTA02731465](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2012/EFTA02731465.pdf))

A victim's handwritten journal includes the passage (reconstructed from the FBI briefing's Prominent Names page):
> "[Epstein] earned his money from Wexner"

This victim knowledge of Epstein's financial source suggests Epstein spoke openly about Wexner to victims.

#### J. FBI "Secondary Co-Conspirator" Designation ([EFTA00175080](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00175080.pdf)) — NOW DOWNLOADED AND VERIFIED

This 3-page email chain from FBI Squad C-20 (Crimes Against Children/Human Trafficking, FBI New York), dated August 15-16, 2019 (the day after Epstein's death), contains the complete co-conspirator briefing. Subject line: **"RE: Epstein co-conspirators --- UNCLASSIFIED"**. Attachment: "baseball_cards.docx" (co-conspirator profiles).

The document lists co-conspirators in two tiers:

**Primary co-conspirators** (names partially redacted but identifiable from context):
- Person in NYC with Miami/NC homes — personal assistant, "arranged massage appointments," "took photos of partially nude girls, some stored in binders," "instructed [redacted] to remove evidence from Epstein's residence"
- Person in Florida — cooperating, provided proffer on co-conspirators including "Marcincova and Maxwell"
- Person in Connecticut — personal assistant, "in charge of making phone calls to set up massage appointments," "had a reverse proffer in SDNY"
- **Ghislaine Maxwell** — "currently living in Boston MA," "subpoena has been served," "reverse proffer date is set for September"

**Secondary co-conspirators:**
- **Jean Luc Brunel** — "Owner of MC2 model agency," subpoena served, "limited evidence"
- Person in London since ~2011 — "not a US citizen; FBI drafted an FDR requesting assistance from Legat London"
- **Leslie Wexner** — "Resides in Ohio. SDNY is currently in contact with his attorneys and a subpoena has been served. There is limited evidence regarding his involvement."

#### K. FBI FD-302 Victim Statement on Wexner ([EFTA01688359](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01688359.pdf), page 13) — FULL-CORPUS FIND

An FBI FD-302 (sworn witness interview), case 31E-MM-108062, dated 03/17/2011. A victim told the FBI:
- She **"provided an erotic massage to LESLIE WEXNER in New York, New York"**
- "EPSTEIN and WEXNER were close friends and had regular contact"
- She **"described WEXNER as a creep"**
- "An unknown individual sent EPSTEIN three 12-year-old girls from France as a birthday gift"
- The girls "seemed to have been prepped for what they were doing with EPSTEIN"
- "EPSTEIN bragged that he had just purchased a girl from her mother. The girl was Czechoslovakian or Yugoslavian"

If this victim's account is accurate, it contradicts Wexner's attorneys' proffer that he "had no knowledge of any inappropriate or unlawful activity." Wexner has not been charged, and the victim's allegation has not been adjudicated.

#### L. Victim Complaint: 1996 Report Naming Wexner ([EFTA01649922](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01649922.pdf)) — FULL-CORPUS FIND

A victim emailed the FBI's EpsteinVictimList mailbox on September 28, 2019: **"I am the Epstein/Maxwell/Wexner victim that reported EVERYTHING in 1996."** She continued: "I have been ignored since my second interview in 2006. I need therapy to deal with what the FBI has done to me, as much as I do for what Epstein did."

This is a victim who reported in **1996** — 12 years before the 2008 plea deal — and specifically named Wexner alongside Epstein and Maxwell.

#### M. Dershowitz Affidavit: Victoria's Secret Lingerie Abuse ([EFTA01681842](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01681842.pdf)) — FULL-CORPUS FIND

Alan Dershowitz's sworn affidavit alleges victim's lawyers brought claims that "Mr. Wexner had engaged in sexual contact with her when she was a minor on numerous occasions, including on Epstein's island, his ranch in New Mexico, his house in Palm Beach, and his home in New York" and that **"Mr. Wexner had made [her] dress up in baby doll lingerie of the type made by Victoria's Secret."** Wexner's attorney John Zieger "confirmed that [lawyers] had a meeting to resolve a situation involving Mr. Wexner."

#### N. Giuffre Deposition on Wexner ([EFTA01657683](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01657683.pdf), page 26) — FULL-CORPUS FIND

Virginia Giuffre, under oath, was asked if Wexner "would have relevant information about Jeffrey's taking advantage of underage girls." She responded: **"I think he has relevant information, but I don't think he'll tell you the truth."**

#### O. Financial Trust Income Collapse ([EFTA01682059](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01682059.pdf)) — FULL-CORPUS FIND

Financial Trust Company fee income: $66 million (2006) → $4 million (2007, the year Wexner severed ties) → $100,000 (2008). This strongly suggests Wexner was essentially Epstein's only significant client — a 94% revenue drop coinciding with Wexner's departure is difficult to explain otherwise.

#### P. Congressional Subpoena (January-February 2026)

- **January 8, 2026**: House Oversight Committee voted to subpoena Wexner
- **February 16, 2026**: Wexner scheduled for deposition before the House Oversight Committee
- Subpoenas also issued for Darren Indyke and Richard Kahn (Epstein estate executors)
- Wexner's legal representative stated he will "cooperate fully with any governmental inquiry"
- Rep. Nancy Mace publicly questioned: "If Les Wexner is listed by the DOJ/FBI as a co-conspirator, why isn't he in jail?"

### Assessment
Leslie Wexner occupies a unique position among the six names: he is the documented source of Epstein's wealth and the person most extensively referenced in the prosecution files. The SDNY obtained an attorney proffer from Wexner's counsel on July 25, 2019 — just weeks after Epstein's arrest. The evidence trail includes:
- An FBI FD-302 in which a victim states she "provided an erotic massage to LESLIE WEXNER" (§K)
- A victim who reported Wexner by name in **1996** (§L)
- A sworn affidavit describing Victoria's Secret lingerie used in alleged abuse (§M)
- Victim testimony describing Victoria's Secret as a recruitment tool (§D, §E)
- FBI designation as "secondary co-conspirator" with "limited evidence regarding his involvement" (§J)
- Financial Trust income data strongly suggesting Wexner was Epstein's only significant client (§O)
- A dedicated "Wexner: Epstein investigation" file (§G)
- Victim testimony from Giuffre: "I don't think he'll tell you the truth" (§N)

Wexner was never charged. The prosecution memo's assessment that Wexner "had no knowledge of any inappropriate or unlawful activity" comes from his own attorneys' representation. Multiple victim statements allege direct sexual misconduct by Wexner — allegations he has denied. The FBI's own co-conspirator briefing noted "limited evidence regarding his involvement." Wexner is scheduled to testify before the House Oversight Committee on February 16, 2026.

# SECTION 3: WHY THESE SIX NAMES WERE REDACTED

## 3.1 The 2008 NPA Protection

The Non-Prosecution Agreement ([EFTA00027666](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00027666.pdf)) explicitly states:
> "not institute any criminal charges against any potential co-conspirators of Epstein, including but not limited to [NAMES]"

Epstein's defense attorney Jack Lefkowitz then demanded ([EFTA00027666](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00027666.pdf) page 10):
> "Neither federal agents nor anyone from your Office should contact the identified individuals to inform them of the resolution of the case"

This created a regime where: (1) the co-conspirators were protected from prosecution, (2) the victims were not informed, and (3) even the existence of the NPA was concealed.

## 3.2 The Ongoing Redaction

When these documents were released publicly, the FBI redacted the co-conspirator names. Rep. Khanna and Rep. Massie, having access to unredacted versions in the congressional reading room, chose to read them onto the House floor using their constitutional privilege.

## 3.3 The Pattern of Non-Prosecution

Of the six names:
- **Wexner**: Attorney proffer obtained, never charged
- **Sultan bin Sulayem**: 40+ documents, victim testimony, port access — never charged
- **Nuara, Mikeladze, Leonov, Caputo**: Not even investigated in the 2019 SDNY case (zero mentions in the 86-page prosecution memo)

This pattern is consistent with the broader prosecution failure documented across the Epstein case: the NPA protected co-conspirators, the SDNY investigation focused on the inner circle (Groff, Brunel, Maxwell) and the 2019 charges, and the lesser-known co-conspirators were never pursued.

# APPENDIX A: PROSECUTION MEMO WEXNER SECTION — FULL TEXT EXTRACTION

Source: [EFTA02731082](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2012/EFTA02731082.pdf), Pages 65-67

**d. Counsel for Leslie Wexner**

On July 25, 2019, counsel for Wexner provided us with an attorney proffer. Wexner is the billionaire founder and CEO of L Brands (formerly Limited Brands) corporation, which controls Victoria's Secret, among other retail brands. It has been publicly reported that Wexner and Epstein had a close relationship and that Epstein managed Wexner's finances from the 1990s through the 2000s.

During our meeting, Wexner's attorneys indicated that Wexner had no knowledge of any inappropriate or unlawful activity with young women by Epstein. The attorneys emphasized Wexner's relationship with Epstein was more professional than social. The attorneys also explained that over his years handling Wexner's finances, Epstein stole or otherwise misappropriated several hundred million dollars from Wexner. That misconduct, together with fees that Epstein paid himself for his services to Wexner, appears to account for virtually all of Epstein's wealth.

Wexner first met Epstein in the 1980s through a mutual friend who recommended Epstein as a financial adviser. [...]

[The townhouse at 9 E 71st St] belonged to Wexner, but the Wexners had moved out of it in 1995. Epstein also sold himself a private plane that previously belonged to Wexner at a deeply discounted price.

In the 1990s, Epstein told Wexner that he had other clients and that Wexner did not need to pay Epstein because Epstein was having fun and they would settle up later. Epstein introduced Wexner to a number of other people as his clients, and Wexner interacted with other prominent people who knew Epstein, such as Prince Andrew, professors at Harvard, and a sultan in Dubai. Epstein had no formal role in L Brands or Victoria's Secret. At some point, Wexner heard a rumor that Epstein might be holding himself out as connected to Victoria's Secret, but when Wexner asked Epstein about it, Epstein denied doing so.

Epstein handled Wexner's personal business affairs until 2007, when Wexner learned that Epstein had stolen or otherwise misappropriated several hundred million dollars from Wexner. Around that time, Epstein told Wexner that he was having legal problems involving an overly aggressive police chief and some sort of massage. Epstein said he was being blackmailed and it could get messy, so it would be best for Wexner's wife to take over the family finances. In response, Wexner's wife looked into the state of their finances and discovered that Epstein had misappropriated a significant amount of the family's funds. For example, Epstein frequently bought property on behalf of the Wexners and then sold it to himself for a fraction of the cost.

The Wexners then decided to cut off Epstein. When confronted, Epstein tried to convince Wexner's wife that she did not understand the financials and insisted that he had the Wexners' best interests at heart. The Wexners did not want to bring unnecessary public attention to the issue, so they withdrew the power of attorney, and hired counsel to negotiate a private settlement with Epstein. As a result of those negotiations, Epstein agreed to return $100 million to the Wexners, which he did in January of 2008. At that point, Wexner severed all ties with Epstein, and he has not seen or spoken to Epstein since.

Wexner knows nothing about the [REDACTED] claim from [REDACTED] and explained that at the time, Epstein owned a property adjacent to the Wexners about a half mile away from the Wexners's property. The Wexners's security team is not aware of any inappropriate incident taking place on the Wexners's property, and the Wexners first heard about [REDACTED] allegations from public reporting this year.

### Key observations:

1. **Source column**: Nearly all entries cite NYPD complaints (dates ranging 1998-2021). Epstein himself is sourced to "PB" (Palm Beach, 2006). Maxwell is sourced to "US PP" (US Probation/Prosecution, 2003).

2. **Two names remain redacted**: #5 and #13. DOBs, sources, and even the "P" column are blacked out for these entries. The reason for continued redaction is unknown — possibilities include that these individuals are minors, cooperating witnesses, persons with ongoing legal proceedings, or that the redaction was maintained for other reasons.

3. **Wexner and Sultan bin Sulayem are NOT on this list.** They appear in other documents (prosecution memo, FBI "secondary co-conspirator" designation). The Khanna 6 came from **multiple source documents**, not just [EFTA00077895](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00077895.pdf).

4. **Rep. Khanna stated the DOJ "blanket-redacted anyone who was a female."** The presence of 10 female names (Sheshelouskaya, Warren, Rzhevskaya, Mette, Hicky, Rivera, Weber, Castiel, Kateryna, Manzella, Villarini, Greco) is consistent with this — these may be victims who filed NYPD complaints, witnesses, or facilitators like Sarah Kellen and Nadia Marcinkova.

5. **Post-2019 dates** (Mikeladze 2021, Leonov 2021, Villarini 2021, Mette 2020, Warren 2019): These NYPD complaints were filed AFTER Epstein's arrest and death, suggesting new witnesses came forward during the SDNY investigation and its aftermath.

6. **Pre-2008 dates** (Hicky 1998, Sheshelouskaya 1999, Greco 2001, Maxwell 2003, Epstein 2006): These trace to the original Palm Beach/NYPD investigations that preceded the 2008 NPA.

### Previously known NPA co-conspirators (from 2007-2008 legal proceedings):
- Sarah Kellen
- Lesley Groff
- Adriana Ross (Adriana Mucinska)
- Nadia Marcinkova (now Nadia Marcinko)

**NOTE**: None of these four previously known co-conspirators appear on the [EFTA00077895](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00077895.pdf) list, suggesting this list represents a DIFFERENT set of individuals — possibly the names that follow "including but not limited to" in the NPA clause, or a separate FBI compilation of persons of interest from NYPD complaint filings.

### Lyle Castiel -- Maxwell's UBS Financial Advisor (NEW CROSS-REFERENCE, Feb 12, 2026)

[EFTA01274941](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01274941.pdf) (DS10, page 192): UBS account statement for Ghislaine Maxwell listing her financial advisor as "SCOTT STACKMAN/LYLE CASTIEL" (phone 212.871.7000), with an account value of $1,545,229.89. **Miryan Castiel** appears as #12 on the [EFTA00077895](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00077895.pdf) co-conspirator list (NYPD 2016). The shared "Castiel" surname raises a potential familial connection between the co-conspirator list entry and Maxwell's financial infrastructure. This remains speculative but warrants further investigation.

*Report compiled from full-corpus text extraction of 1,380,937 documents (2,731,796 pages) across Datasets 1-12, plus 3.4M+ document text database records, 21,859 analyzed images, direct PDF downloads from Dataset 9 ([EFTA00077895](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00077895.pdf), [EFTA00175080](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00175080.pdf), [EFTA00666117](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00666117.pdf)), and public web sources. All six Khanna names are confirmed in the EFTA corpus. Four names (Nuara, Mikeladze, Leonov, Caputo) appear ONLY on the [EFTA00077895](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00077895.pdf) co-conspirator list — their absence from the remaining 1.38M documents is definitive. Sultan bin Sulayem appears in 5,026 documents and Leslie Wexner in 1,497 documents (updated Feb 12, 2026).*
