# WILLIAM BARR: COMPLETE INVESTIGATION OF ALLEGATIONS IN THE EPSTEIN FBI FILES

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

William Pelham Barr appears in the Epstein FBI files in **three distinct capacities**: (1) as a subject of an NTOC (National Threat Operations Center) tip alleging he was present during abuses at Epstein's residence, documented in the FBI's own Prominent Names briefing; (2) as the sitting U.S. Attorney General who oversaw the federal response to Epstein's death in custody on August 10, 2019, including the death investigation under case number 90A-NY-3151227; and (3) as a figure with pre-existing connections to Epstein through his father Donald Barr, who hired Epstein to teach at the Dalton School, and through his former law firm Kirkland & Ellis, which represented Epstein in the 2008 Florida non-prosecution deal.

This investigation identified **55 documents** across the FBI file databases that reference William Barr directly or as Attorney General in connection with Epstein. The Barr allegations appear in **4 separate versions** of the FBI's Prominent Names briefing document, as well as in news clips, legal correspondence, situational reports, and internal FBI communications.

## SECTION 1: THE PROMINENT NAMES BRIEFING -- BARR ALLEGATIONS

### 1.1 The Core Allegation

The FBI's own internal "Prominent Names" briefing page (page 17/18 of a multi-page document) contains a dedicated section on **"William Barr/Leon Black"** that summarizes NTOC tips received about Barr. This section appears in four known versions of the document:

| EFTA Number | Document Type |
|---|---|
| [EFTA01660622](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01660622.pdf) | Prominent Names briefing (primary/most complete version) |
| [EFTA01656152](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01656152.pdf) | Prominent Names briefing (earlier variant) |
| [EFTA01656173](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01656173.pdf) | Prominent Names briefing (variant) |
| [EFTA01656198](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01656198.pdf) | Prominent Names briefing (variant) |
| [EFTA00164939](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00164939.pdf) | Prominent Names briefing (DS9 copy, confirmed same content) |

### 1.2 Reconstructed Text from [EFTA01660622](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01660622.pdf), Page 17

The most complete version ([EFTA01660622](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01660622.pdf)) contains TWO overlapping redaction layers that, when combined, reconstruct the full text. The left column contains victim names (still partially redacted), while the right column contains the allegation summaries.

**Full reconstructed text of the William Barr/Leon Black section:**

> **William Barr/Leon Black:**
>
> 1. NTOC filed by [name redacted], stated Barr and Black were present during abuses.
>
> [name redacted] stated she was at Epstein's for a model event and ran into Barr who stated he wanted to see her next time he came. At another point, Epstein asked if she had ever met Barr.
>
> *Numerous anonymous NTOC's were received with allegations against prominent individuals.
>
> ** Criminal history

### 1.3 Analysis of the Allegation

The Barr allegation contains **two distinct components**:

**Component A -- The NTOC Tip (Abuse Allegation):** A named individual (identity redacted) filed a formal NTOC tip stating that both William Barr and Leon Black "were present during abuses." This is a direct allegation of presence during criminal conduct. The fact that the FBI briefing pairs Barr with Leon Black is significant because Black himself is the subject of separate, more detailed abuse allegations on the same page (Leon Black section), including allegations of forced massage and oral sex, and threats against victims.

**Component B -- The Model Event Encounter:** The same or a related individual stated she was at Epstein's residence for a "model event" and encountered Barr there. Barr allegedly told her he "wanted to see her next time he came." Additionally, at a separate point in time, Epstein asked this individual whether she had "ever met Barr." The meaning of this exchange is ambiguous — it could indicate anything from social networking to more concerning intent — but it places Barr in Epstein's social orbit per the tipster's account.

### 1.4 Significance

- The allegation is **internally sourced** -- it appears in the FBI's own briefing materials prepared by agents for case review, not in media reports or public filings.
- The NTOC tip was filed by a **named individual** (not anonymous), which the FBI distinguishes from the "numerous anonymous NTOC's" noted at the bottom of the page.
- The "model event" detail is consistent with known Epstein patterns of using modeling events as recruitment opportunities, including through Jean-Luc Brunel's MC2 Model Management (see [EFTA01728258](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01728258.pdf)).
- Epstein asking the victim if she had "ever met Barr" places Barr within Epstein's social awareness, though the significance of this exchange is ambiguous.

### 1.5 Cross-Referencing the NTOC Tip Victim

The victim name in the Barr NTOC tip is redacted in all versions of the Prominent Names briefing. The redaction pattern shows "NTOC filed by [blank], stated Barr and" -- indicating a female name was removed. The same victim appears to have provided both Component A (the abuse allegation) and Component B (the model event encounter), as the text flows as a single narrative entry.

---

## SECTION 2: THE NTOC TIPS DOCUMENTS

### 2.1 [EFTA01660651](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01660651.pdf) and [EFTA01660679](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01660679.pdf) -- NTOC Tip Spreadsheets

These two documents are comprehensive NTOC tip logs that record all tips received by the FBI's National Threat Operations Center related to Epstein. They contain columns for: the tip allegation text, the named individuals, the FBI follow-up actions, and criminal history checks.

**Key finding:** The Barr-specific NTOC tip does not appear in the Trump-focused sections of these spreadsheets (pages 0-4 of both documents are dominated by Trump-related tips). The Barr tip appears to be logged elsewhere in the NTOC system, as the Prominent Names briefing references it but the available NTOC spreadsheet pages focus primarily on tips naming Trump.

### 2.2 Model Event Context from NTOC Tips

The NTOC tip spreadsheet ([EFTA01660651](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01660651.pdf), page 0) contains a related entry about modeling events at Epstein's:

> "At age 16, while modeling, caller attended 8 parties at Epstein's New York residence. On one occasion, caller reported she was sexually assaulted by Epstein. On another occasion, two twin brothers, Allen and Oren, lured caller and her friend upstairs but they escaped back downstairs."

This tip -- while about a different caller -- confirms the pattern of young models being invited to Epstein's New York residence under the pretense of "model events" or "parties," which is the same context described in the Barr allegation.

### 2.3 Victoria's Secret / Modeling Connection

The NTOC tips repeatedly reference Victoria's Secret models and modeling events as vectors for Epstein's trafficking. The Barr tip's reference to a "model event" connects to Epstein's known use of modeling industry connections through Les Wexner (Victoria's Secret), Jean-Luc Brunel (MC2 Model Management), and others.

## SECTION 3: BARR'S RECUSAL DECISIONS

### 3.1 The Recusal Question -- [EFTA00018398](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00018398.pdf)

A critical FBI file document ([EFTA00018398](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00018398.pdf)) contains a CNBC article from July 9, 2019, circulated internally within the DOJ/SDNY with "High" importance, detailing Barr's recusal decisions:

**Key facts from the document:**

> "Attorney General William Barr will not recuse himself from involvement in the new federal criminal prosecution of accused child sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein, an official said Tuesday."
>
> "But Barr will recuse himself from an internal Justice Department probe of current Labor Secretary's Alex Acosta involvement in approving a controversial no-prosecution deal with the wealthy financier a decade ago."
>
> **Barr's own statement (quoted Monday):** "I'm recused from that matter because one of the law firms that represented Epstein long ago was a firm I subsequently joined for a period of time."
>
> "Barr joined that law firm, Kirkland & Ellis, in 2009. Kirkland & Ellis had represented Epstein in 2008, when he was being investigated in Florida."
>
> **DOJ clarification:** "Due to his prior association with Kirkland and Ellis, the Attorney General has and will remain recused from any retrospective review of the resolution of the earlier [Southern District of Florida] matter."

### 3.2 The Kirkland & Ellis Connection

Multiple documents detail the role of Kirkland & Ellis in the original Epstein non-prosecution agreement:

- **[EFTA00009016](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%207/EFTA00009016.pdf)** (Acosta deposition transcript): Ken Starr and Jay Lefkowitz of Kirkland & Ellis are identified as Epstein's defense counsel who met with prosecutors to argue against federal prosecution. Acosta testified about receiving calls from Kirkland & Ellis after the August 2007 charging letter.

- **[EFTA00013989](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00013989.pdf)** (Kirkland & Ellis letter): A June 19, 2008 letter from Kirkland & Ellis to prosecutors on behalf of Epstein, arguing against prosecution and invoking Brady requirements.

**[NEW -- DS9 K&E Documents]:**
- **[EFTA00067343](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00067343.pdf)** (DS9): 10-page Kirkland & Ellis "Response to Letter by FAUSA" -- K&E's point-by-point rebuttal of SDFL claims, accusing prosecutors of "inconsistencies, false and misleading characterizations and outright falsehoods."
- **[EFTA00067353](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00067353.pdf)** (DS9): K&E "SUMMARY OF MISCONDUCT ISSUES" -- detailed allegations of prosecutorial misconduct, including that prosecutors "misrepresented the number of alleged victims."
- **[EFTA00066350](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00066350.pdf)** (DS9): "EPSTEIN BOX INVENTORY" listing physical evidence boxes including "Data Demonstratives Kirkland & Ellis LLP -- 6 bound copies" and extensive Lefkowitz correspondence with Sloman and Acosta spanning September-December 2007.
- **[EFTA00065022](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00065022.pdf)** (DS9): SDNY News Clips noting Robert Khuzami (former SDNY prosecutor) took positions "as general counsel for Deutsche Bank and as a partner at Kirkland & Ellis" -- another SDNY official with K&E ties.

These K&E defense documents demonstrate the aggressive legal strategy employed by the same firm Barr joined the following year (2009).

### 3.3 The Split Recusal -- Analysis

Barr's decision to recuse only from the retrospective review of the Florida deal, but NOT from the active prosecution or oversight of the Epstein case, meant that:

1. Barr maintained direct oversight of the SDNY's sex trafficking prosecution
2. Barr maintained oversight of the Bureau of Prisons where Epstein was held
3. Barr personally oversaw the death investigation after August 10, 2019
4. Barr was NOT recused from any matter where the NTOC tip alleging his presence at Epstein's during abuses would be relevant

### 3.5 Death Investigation Recusal Deliberation -- [EFTA00078028](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00078028.pdf) (DS9)

**[NEW -- DS9 FINDING]:** On August 12, 2019 -- just two days after Epstein's death -- SDNY internally debated whether to recuse from the criminal investigation of the MCC and its guards. The SDNY Deputy asked the IG whether SDNY "should be recused from the criminal investigation of the MCC and its guards relating to Epstein's suicide." The IG said "he saw no basis for our recusal." The ODAG Associate Deputy Counsel said "he saw no basis for our recusal because any possible conflict was too speculative." When asked if the OAG (Barr's office) should be consulted, ODAG said "that was unnecessary because the question would ultimately be brought back to him."

This shows the non-recusal decision for the death investigation was made at the IG/ODAG level, without consulting the Attorney General's office directly. While this aligned with Barr's broader non-recusal posture, it means Barr himself was not personally consulted on this specific question.

### 3.6 SDFL Recusal Evidence Transfer -- [EFTA00074673](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00074673.pdf) (DS9)

**[NEW -- DS9 FINDING]:** In April 2019, SDFL's Criminal Chief confirmed "we are recused" from Epstein matters. Critically, "Miami FBI has expressed a reluctance to send any 6e materials to the SDNY FBI without a 6e letter." This reveals bureaucratic obstacles created by SDFL's recusal that impeded evidence transfer to SDNY -- a practical consequence of the fractured recusal architecture.

### 3.7 ODAG Coordination -- [EFTA00080472](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00080472.pdf) (DS9)

**[NEW -- DS9 FINDING]:** An ODAG official stated "my only real role related to recusal issues and consequences," confirming that recusal management was a significant DOJ coordination burden through at least July-August 2020 (Maxwell prosecution phase).

### 3.4 Additional Recusal Context -- [EFTA00028149](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00028149.pdf)

Internal SDNY prosecution emails reveal that the Southern District of Florida had been "ordered recused by the DOJ from criminal matters concerning Mr. Epstein at a much earlier date" -- a fact that defense attorneys noted while pressing for information about the genesis of the SDNY investigation.

---

## SECTION 4: BARR AND THE DALTON SCHOOL / DONALD BARR

### 4.1 Grand Jury Subpoena to Dalton School -- [EFTA00009632](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%207/EFTA00009632.pdf)

Federal grand jury proceedings transcript reveals that prosecutors issued a subpoena to the Dalton School:

> "We have issued a Grand Jury subpoena to the Dalton school located in New York and at this time they do not have the records we have requested or could not locate those."

This subpoena was issued as part of the federal investigation into Epstein. The Dalton School is where **Donald Barr** -- William Barr's father -- served as headmaster from 1964 to 1974. Donald Barr hired Jeffrey Epstein to teach mathematics and physics at Dalton in approximately 1974, despite Epstein not having a college degree at the time. Epstein was approximately 20 years old when hired.

### 4.2 NYT Article Confirmation -- [EFTA00020787](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00020787.pdf)

The New York Times article from August 23, 2019 ("Barr Seized on Epstein Case as Doubts Mounted About Justice Dept."), which was circulated within SDNY, explicitly acknowledges both connections:

> "Even Mr. Barr had chance ties to Mr. Epstein: His old law firm, Kirkland & Ellis, had worked with Mr. Epstein on the Miami deal, and decades earlier, **Mr. Barr's father had hired Mr. Epstein to teach at Dalton, the elite private school in Manhattan.**"

### 4.3 No "Donald Barr" Direct References

A search of all three databases for "Donald Barr" returned zero results, indicating that the FBI files do not contain direct references to William Barr's father by name. The Dalton connection is referenced only through the grand jury subpoena and the NYT article.

---

## SECTION 5: BARR'S ROLE IN THE EPSTEIN DEATH INVESTIGATION

### 5.1 Case Number: 90A-NY-3151227

The FBI death investigation was opened under case number **90A-NY-3151227**, classified as "UNSUB(S); JEFFREY EPSTEIN - VICTIM; DEATH INVESTIGATION." This case file contains extensive documentation including:

- FD-302 interview reports of MCC correctional officers
- CART (Computer Analysis Response Team) evidence submissions
- Video system analysis from MCC
- Situational Reports (SITREPs)

### 5.2 Barr's Personal Involvement -- Timeline

**August 10, 2019 (Day of Death):**
- Epstein found unresponsive at approximately 6:30 AM EDT with a makeshift noose around his neck ([EFTA00147294](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00147294.pdf))
- Barr was at home when his chief of staff called ([EFTA00020787](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00020787.pdf))

**August 12, 2019 (FOP Speech in New Orleans -- [EFTA00023984](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00023984.pdf)):**
- Barr flew to New Orleans and delivered remarks at the Fraternal Order of Police's 64th National Biennial Conference
- Opening remarks: "I was appalled -- indeed, the entire Department was -- and frankly angry, to learn of the MCC's failure to adequately secure this prisoner. We are now learning of serious irregularities at this facility that are deeply concerning and that demand a thorough investigation."
- Stated: "Let me assure you that this case will continue on against anyone who was complicit with Epstein. Any co-conspirators should not rest easy."

**August 12, 2019 (SITREP -- [EFTA00147294](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00147294.pdf)):**
- VCTF, SDNY, and OIG concluded interview of MCC Warden -- "No significant information provided"

- Four MCC staff agreed to interviews
- **"The two guards that were the first to discover Epstein have both referred the FBI/OIG to their attorneys and have not yet agreed to be interviewed"**
- FBI search of Little St. James Island initiated simultaneously
- A drone from an unknown point of origin monitored the search from close range

**August 19-20, 2019 (Investigation Updates -- [EFTA00019402](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00019402.pdf)):**
- Barr vowed "a full investigation into the federal prison"
- Barr stated he was "appalled... and frankly, angry to learn of MCC's failure to adequately secure this prisoner"

- FBI interviewed inmate Steven Lopez at MCC about "possible shredding of Epstein documents" -- Lopez had no information
- FBI interviewed BOP guards, one of whom "stopped interview upon starting it asking for an attorney"
- OIG planned to serve "last outstanding subpoena to BOP Officer Kale"

**August 23, 2019 (NYT Profile -- [EFTA00020787](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00020787.pdf)):**
- Barr described as "personally overseeing the four federal inquiries" and "briefed on them multiple times a day"
- Barr suspended two prison employees, transferred the warden (Lamine N'Diaye), and appointed Kathleen Hawk Sawyer to run Bureau of Prisons
- Barr "defended the coroner's report, saying he had seen nothing to contradict it"
- **Unresolved:** "The Bureau of Prisons has not yet said whether security cameras in the cell block showed anyone entering and leaving Mr. Epstein's cell in the hours before he died"

### 5.3 Key Details from the Death Investigation Files

**The Cellmate Removal ([EFTA00147294](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00147294.pdf)):**
> "In the morning hours of 8/9/2019, Epstein's cell mate, Efrain Reyes, was released from the MCC, leaving Epstein alone in his cell."

**The Unmonitored Phone Call ([EFTA00147294](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00147294.pdf)):**
> "On 8/9/2019 at approximately 7:19 p.m. EDT, an MCC Correctional Officer allows Epstein to make a phone call on an unsecured and unmonitored line. The call was to Karyna Shuliak and was approximately 20 minutes in length."

**Suicide Watch History ([EFTA00147294](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00147294.pdf)):**
- 7/8/2019: Placed on suicide watch
- 7/10/2019: Removed from suicide watch after evaluation
- 7/23/2019: First suicide attempt via hanging, discovered unconscious at 1:27 AM
- 7/29/2019: Removed from suicide watch again
- 8/10/2019: Found dead

**Suicide Watch Concerns ([EFTA00035544](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00035544.pdf)):**
Internal MCC emails from July 24, 2019 reveal staff discussion about Epstein being allowed to attend legal visits in regular clothes while on suicide watch, and debate about whether he truly needed to be on watch. One email notes "the huge scar on Epstein's neck" and "a ton of ambiguity surrounding the incident."

### 5.4 The OIG Report -- PUBLISHED JUNE 2023 (CORRECTION)

**[EFTA00039025](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00039025.pdf) (DS9): Complete DOJ OIG Report, Case #23-085**

The DOJ OIG published its report on Epstein's death in June 2023 (125+ pages, located in DS9). The Tucker Carlson segment from January 2023 that claimed no report had been issued predated the actual publication by approximately five months.

Key findings from the OIG report:
- Epstein's death was ruled suicide by the Medical Examiner, with injuries "consistent with suicide by hanging" and "no evidence of defensive wounds"
- Available video from one functioning camera showed NO ONE entering Epstein's tier between 10:40 PM on August 9 and 6:30 AM on August 10
- DVR System #2 failed on July 29, 2019 (discovered August 8) -- the L Tier camera was live-streaming but NOT recording
- Guards Noel and Thomas falsified count slips and round sheets; neither conducted any rounds or counts during their overnight shift
- Thomas admitted he was "dozing off from here and there"
- Noel heard Thomas say "Breathe, Epstein, breathe" and "We're going to be in so much [trouble]" upon discovering Epstein
- A sign was posted in the SHU: "MANDATORY ROUNDS MUST BE CONDUCTED EVERY 30 MINUTES ON EPSTEIN #76318-054 AS PER GOD!!!!"
- Epstein's cellmate was transferred out on August 9 with no replacement assigned, despite an explicit written requirement for a cellmate
- Epstein made an unmonitored phone call on an unsecured line on August 9
- Guards Noel and Thomas were charged November 19, 2019; entered deferred prosecution agreements May 25, 2021

The OIG report was published more than 2.5 years after Barr left office (January 2021), so the criticism that no report was issued DURING Barr's tenure remains valid. The OPR report on the 2006-2008 investigation was completed under Barr (November 2020) -- see below.

**OPR Report -- [EFTA00039867](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00039867.pdf) / [EFTA00039868](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00039868.pdf) (DS9):**
The OPR final report on the Acosta/SDFL investigation was transmitted to SDNY on November 12, 2020 and released publicly. OPR concluded: "OPR did not find that Department attorneys engaged in professional misconduct" but "former U.S. Attorney Acosta exercised poor judgment." This was completed under Barr's tenure.

### 5.5 The "Perfect Storm of Screw-ups"

**Tucker Carlson Segment -- January 25, 2023 ([EFTA00035791](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00035791.pdf)):**

This document contains a critique of Barr's handling. **[NOTE: Carlson's claim that no OIG report had been issued was accurate at the time of broadcast (January 2023) but became outdated when the OIG published its report in June 2023.]**

Carlson raised questions about:
- Whether cells on Epstein's tier were locked the entire night
- Who moved Epstein's body
- Who re-dressed Epstein's corpse and intubated it
- The DOJ case officer (identified as Lyeson Daniel) "refused even to acknowledge that he worked for the federal government"

### 5.5 BOP Response Under Barr's Direction

**[EFTA00035442](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00035442.pdf) / [EFTA00034363](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00034363.pdf)** (BOP Communications):
Bureau of Prisons internal emails show that after Epstein's death, BOP public affairs was instructed: "the only thing we are saying now is we can provide the AG's statement and we decline further comment."

**Senator Ben Sasse Letter to Barr ([EFTA00023980](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00023980.pdf)):**
> "The Department of Justice failed, and today Jeffrey Epstein's co-conspirators think they might have just gotten one last sweetheart deal. Every single person in the Justice Department -- from your Main Justice headquarters staff all the way to the night-shift jailer -- knew that this man was a suicide risk, and that his dark secrets couldn't be allowed to die with him."

## SECTION 6: BARR'S CREDIBILITY AND INDEPENDENCE CONCERNS

### 6.1 SDNY Independence -- [EFTA00014243](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00014243.pdf)

The SDNY News Clips from March 9, 2020 document two critical developments:

**Berman Asserts Independence:** U.S. Attorney Geoffrey Berman publicly asserted his office's independence from Barr's DOJ, stating: "The Southern District of New York has a long history of integrity and pursuing cases and declining to pursue cases based only on the facts and the law and the equities, without regard to partisan political concerns."

**Judge Walton's Opinion on Barr:** A separate article in the same clips documents Judge Reggie Walton's "blistering opinion" finding that Barr demonstrated "lack of candor" regarding the Mueller Report that "calls into question Attorney General Barr's credibility."

### 6.2 MCC Staff Transfers Under Barr -- [EFTA00014243](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00014243.pdf)

Warden Lamine N'Diaye was moved to a desk job after Epstein's death. When N'Diaye was later expected to assume a leadership role at Fort Dix, "U.S. Attorney General William Barr intervened and ordered the transfer be put on hold while investigations" continued. The MCC captain Jermaine Darden was transferred to Fort Dix as "emergency preparedness officer" -- described by defense attorney Montell Figgins as evidence that upper ranks faced no real consequences.

## SECTION 7: ADDITIONAL BARR-ADJACENT FILE REFERENCES

### 7.1 [EFTA00021197](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00021197.pdf)
Contains reference to "People v. William Barr" -- an editorial arguing that "when the Justice Department acts like a private law firm for a president trying to avoid accountability to Congress."

### 7.2 [EFTA00015687](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00015687.pdf)
An open letter to AG William Barr about guardianship abuse in Florida, found in the Epstein file collection, dated March 3, 2020.

### 7.3 [EFTA00032454](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00032454.pdf)
Legal industry news noting Matthew Whitaker's departure from DOJ "less than a month after William Barr was sworn in to replace him," alongside Mueller investigation coverage.

## SECTION 8: CONFLICT OF INTEREST ANALYSIS

William Barr's involvement in the Epstein matter presents **multiple layers of conflict**:

| Conflict | Details |
|---|---|
| **Father hired Epstein** | Donald Barr, as headmaster of Dalton School, hired Epstein circa 1974 |
| **Law firm represented Epstein** | Barr joined Kirkland & Ellis in 2009; the firm represented Epstein in 2008 Florida case |
| **Subject of NTOC abuse allegation** | A named tipster alleged Barr was "present during abuses" at Epstein's residence |

### 8.1 What Barr Recused From vs. What He Didn't

**Recused from:** Retrospective review of the 2008 Florida non-prosecution agreement (the Acosta deal)

**NOT recused from:**
- The active SDNY sex trafficking prosecution
- Oversight of the Bureau of Prisons (where Epstein was held)
- The death investigation
- Any investigation into the NTOC tip naming him personally

---

## SECTION 9: EVIDENCE GAPS AND UNANSWERED QUESTIONS

1. **The NTOC tipster's identity**: The name of the individual who filed the NTOC tip alleging Barr's presence during abuses is redacted in all versions. This individual was a named (not anonymous) complainant, distinguishable from the "numerous anonymous NTOC's" noted separately.

2. **Follow-up on the Barr NTOC tip**: The files do not contain any documented follow-up investigation of the Barr allegation. The Prominent Names briefing appears to be a summary document; the underlying investigative materials are not present in the released files.

3. **The "model event" details**: No additional documentation of the specific "model event" at Epstein's where Barr allegedly appeared has been identified in the files. The timing, location (New York vs. Palm Beach), and other attendees are not specified.

4. **Dalton School records**: The grand jury subpoena to Dalton School was met with a response that records "could not be located." Whether subsequent attempts were made to obtain these records is not documented.

5. **Death investigation final report**: The DOJ OIG published its report in June 2023 ([EFTA00039025](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00039025.pdf), 125+ pages) — more than 2.5 years after Barr left office. No report was issued during Barr's tenure. The OIG report confirmed suicide as cause of death, documented video showing no entry to Epstein's tier between 10:40 PM and 6:30 AM, and detailed catastrophic institutional failures.

6. **Video evidence**: The SITREP ([EFTA00147294](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00147294.pdf)) confirmed that some video of the hallway leading to Epstein's cell "does still exist on the system." The OIG report ([EFTA00039025](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00039025.pdf)) analyzed this video and determined no one entered Epstein's tier between 10:40 PM and 6:30 AM. However, DVR System #2 had failed on July 29, meaning one camera was live-streaming but not recording.

7. **The unmonitored phone call**: Epstein made a 20-minute call on an "unsecured and unmonitored line" to Karyna Shuliak on the evening before his death. The contents of this call have not been disclosed.

## SECTION 11: "EVAN BARR" -- NAME DISAMBIGUATION (DS9/DS11 FINDING)

**[NEW -- DS9/DS11 FINDING]:** The full-corpus revisit revealed a previously unidentified individual named **Evan T. Barr**, a partner at Fried Frank Harris Shriver & Jacobson and former federal prosecutor in New York, who had a direct professional relationship with Epstein. This is a DIFFERENT person from William Barr (AG).

**Key evidence:**
- [EFTA00432333](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00432333.pdf) (DS9): Epstein to Groff: "Reach out to Evan Barr thurs good or fri breakfast" (June 14, 2011)
- [EFTA00432384](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00432384.pdf) (DS9): Groff to Evan Barr: "Jeffrey is in NY and wondering if you might have time to come see him this Thursday..or possibly breakfast this Friday?"
- [EFTA00432254](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00432254.pdf) (DS9): Groff to Epstein: "YOU are to call Evan at his office 3:45-4:00 today" (June 20, 2011)
- [EFTA00304706](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00304706.pdf) (DS9): Calendar entry: "4:00-6:00 Appt w/Evan Barr and Darren" on the SAME DAY as "7:30 DINNER WITH BILL GATES AND BORIS NIKOLIC" and "Peter Mandelson arrives today and will stay at the house"
- [EFTA02348373](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02348373.pdf) (DS11): Ruemmler to Epstein (January 24, 2015): "Ask him about Evan Barr" in response to Epstein saying "your boy comin to breakfast"
- [EFTA00077287](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00077287.pdf) (DS9): "The Prince and the Proffer" article by Evan T. Barr in the New York Law Journal (May 6, 2020), analyzing SDNY's public statements about Prince Andrew's non-cooperation. Disclosure: "He worked on a matter for Epstein years ago while employed at another law firm."
- [EFTA00078332](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00078332.pdf) (DS9): SDNY U.S. Attorney Geoffrey Berman circulated quotes from the Evan Barr article internally

At least four distinct "Barr" individuals appear in the Epstein files:
1. **William P. Barr**: Attorney General (subject of this report)
2. **Evan T. Barr**: Fried Frank partner, former federal prosecutor, direct attorney-client relationship with Epstein (2011-2015+)
3. **Danielle Barr**: Director at The Rug Company, sold rugs to Epstein (2012-2013)
4. **Philippe Barr**: Paris social contact who recommended nightclubs to Epstein (2011)

The Evan Barr finding is relevant because it adds another attorney with DOJ experience to Epstein's network and future researchers should distinguish the two Barrs.

---

## CONCLUSION

The Epstein FBI files reveal that William Barr occupied a uniquely conflicted position in the Epstein matter. He was simultaneously:

1. **A named subject of an NTOC tip** alleging his physical presence during abuses at Epstein's residence, filed by an identified (not anonymous) individual
2. **The Attorney General** with direct oversight over the prosecution, the Bureau of Prisons where Epstein was held, and the death investigation
3. **A person with pre-existing personal and professional connections** to Epstein through his father's hiring of Epstein at Dalton and his former law firm's representation of Epstein

Despite these conflicts, Barr chose to recuse only from the narrow retrospective review of the 2008 Florida deal, maintaining full authority over all other Epstein-related matters. Under his oversight, Epstein died in federal custody under circumstances documented in the June 2023 OIG report ([EFTA00039025](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00039025.pdf)) as resulting from catastrophic institutional failures including guard record falsification, DVR system failure, cellmate removal, and an unmonitored phone call. No investigative report on Epstein's death was published during Barr's tenure (the OIG report came more than 2.5 years after he left office). The two guards who falsified records had their charges dropped. The NTOC tip naming Barr appears to have generated no documented follow-up investigation. The decision not to recuse SDNY from the death investigation was made at the IG/ODAG level on August 12, 2019, without consulting the Attorney General's office directly ([EFTA00078028](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00078028.pdf)).

The Prominent Names briefing included the Barr allegation alongside other named individuals (Trump, Weinstein, Clinton, Prince Andrew, Dershowitz, Lutnick, Dubin, Staley, Black, Wexner). The briefing appears to catalogue all tips received about prominent individuals — including the "numerous anonymous NTOC's" noted at the bottom — rather than making credibility assessments. The allegation's inclusion in a briefing document does not by itself establish its validity. However, the existence of the tip while Barr exercised authority over the Epstein investigation raises conflict-of-interest questions that compound the already-documented conflicts through Dalton and Kirkland & Ellis.

## REVISIT INTEGRATION (2026-02-12)

**Classification: MODERATE**

Full-corpus revisit against DS9 and DS11 integrated above. Key changes:

1. **OIG Report Correction:** The OIG DID publish its report in June 2023 ([EFTA00039025](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00039025.pdf)), correcting this report's prior statement. The report confirmed suicide, documented video evidence, and detailed institutional failures. Published 2.5+ years after Barr left office.
2. **Recusal Architecture Nuanced:** The non-recusal from the death investigation was decided at IG/ODAG level on August 12, 2019 without consulting the AG's office directly ([EFTA00078028](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00078028.pdf)).
3. **Evan Barr Disambiguation:** A distinct individual (Fried Frank partner, former federal prosecutor) had a direct attorney-client relationship with Epstein (2011-2015+). NOT William Barr (AG).
4. **K&E Documents Expanded:** DS9 contains the most extensive K&E defense filings from the NPA negotiation period, including 10-page rebuttal and prosecutorial misconduct allegations.
5. **OPR Report Confirmed:** Completed under Barr's tenure (November 2020), finding Acosta exercised "poor judgment" but no professional misconduct.
6. **Prominent Names -- 5th Copy:** DS9 version ([EFTA00164939](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00164939.pdf)) confirms the same Barr allegations in a different document package.

*Investigation compiled from: primary document text database, OCR text extraction database, image catalog database, and full_text_corpus.db (DS9 + DS11)*
*Total documents analyzed: 85+ containing direct Barr/AG references in Epstein context*
*Date of compilation: February 6, 2026 | Revisit integrated: February 12, 2026*
