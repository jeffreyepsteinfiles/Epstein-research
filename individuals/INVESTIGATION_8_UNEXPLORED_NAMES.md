# INVESTIGATION LINE 8: UNEXPLORED NAMES RESEARCH
## Comprehensive Forensic Analysis of 18 Previously Under-Examined Names in the DOJ Epstein Files

**Database:** the primary document text database
**Date of Analysis:** 2026-02-05
**Analyst:** Independent Forensic Researcher

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

This investigation examined 18 names appearing across the redacted DOJ Epstein files, ranging from 8 to 377+ appearances each. Through systematic database queries across three tables (redactions, extracted_entities, reconstructed_pages) and corroborating open-source research, the names have been categorized into five distinct groups:

1. **Deutsche Bank (DB) Employees** -- Banking staff who managed Epstein's accounts (8 names)
2. **Epstein Household Staff / Property Managers** -- Domestic workers and estate managers (5 names)
3. **Epstein Social/Professional Associates** -- Individuals in Epstein's social orbit (3 names)
4. **Self-Proclaimed Whistleblower / Public Figure** -- Social media personality (1 name)
5. **Institutional Connection** -- Harvard/organizational tie (1 name)

**Key Finding:** The majority of the "unexplored" names are Deutsche Bank employees involved in Epstein's private wealth management accounts (account ending xxx9691 and related accounts) or household staff on his various properties. Several names, however, reveal significant investigative leads, particularly Brice Gordon (property manager who vanished), Barry Josephson (Hollywood producer with deeply concerning email exchanges), and the Jabwcpa Gmail account (Epstein's personal CPA receiving financial reports).

---

## CATEGORY 1: DEUTSCHE BANK (DB) EMPLOYEES

These individuals were employees at Deutsche Bank's Private Wealth Management (PWM) division in New York, servicing Jeffrey Epstein's accounts from approximately 2013-2019.

```

**Assessment:** Gedeon Pinedo was a Deutsche Bank employee in the PWM operations team. He appears exclusively in banking records and report distribution lists. No public records link him to any wrongdoing. His high appearance count (377) reflects the volume of routine banking reports generated for Epstein's accounts.

**Public Record Search:** No results linking "Gedeon Pinedo" to Epstein publicly. Not a person of investigative interest beyond his role as a bank employee.

---

- **Appearances:** 167 redacted text fragments
- **EFTA Range:** [EFTA01451354](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01451354.pdf) -- [EFTA01471473](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01471473.pdf) (DB banking records)

### 3. Firdaus Madiar
- **Appearances:** 83 redacted text fragments (searching "Madiar" and "Firdaus")
- **EFTA Range:** [EFTA01352343](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01352343.pdf) -- [EFTA01438481](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01438481.pdf) (DB banking records)

**Key Transactions Documented:**
- Large withdrawals requiring notification
- Euro currency purchases for "JE acc xxx 9691"
- Wire transfers requiring format validation

**Assessment:** Firdaus Madiar was a Deutsche Bank banker actively processing transactions on Jeffrey Epstein's accounts, including large withdrawals and foreign currency purchases. Her role appears to be more hands-on than the operations/reporting staff (Pinedo, Cothron). She would have had direct knowledge of transaction patterns.

---

### 4. Teresa Metallo
- **Appearances:** 83 redacted text fragments
- **EFTA Range:** [EFTA01356163](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01356163.pdf) -- [EFTA01458839](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01458839.pdf) (DB internal records)

**Assessment:** Teresa Metallo was a Deutsche Bank operations employee (email: a.metallo@db.com). She appears in internal account check/verification emails. Her role was back-office processing of Epstein account-related notifications. Not a person of independent investigative interest.

---

- **EFTA Range:** [EFTA01362152](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01362152.pdf) -- [EFTA01444409](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01444409.pdf) (DB banking records)
- **Distinct Documents:** ~74 unique EFTA numbers

**Assessment:** Brigid Macias was a Deutsche Bank employee who processed transactions on Epstein's accounts, including wire transfers, currency purchases, and corrective entries. She worked closely with Firdaus Madiar and Stewart Oldfield on these transactions. She would have seen the transaction patterns flagged in the DFS enforcement action.

---

### 6. Srikanta Gouda
- **Appearances:** 85 redacted text fragments
- **EFTA Range:** [EFTA01355905](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01355905.pdf) -- [EFTA01398628](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01398628.pdf) (DB banking records)
- **Distinct Documents:** 24 unique EFTA numbers
- **Role Determination:** **Deutsche Bank Derivatives / New Accounts Operations**

**Evidence:**
- All appearances relate to a specific subject: "New Derivatives account"
- Correspondence chain between Keith Buckholz, Surendra Singh, Srikanta Gouda, Nitin-X Singh, FX Middle Office, Scott, Halina Laczny, Hiren Mathur, Enid Ellis, Collateral-Assets, CUSTOMERBUILD BLO
- To/Cc patterns: "To: Keith Buckholz, Cc: Srikanta Gouda; FX Middle Office; Collateral"
- Srikanta Gouda appears to be the primary contact for setting up Epstein's new derivatives account
- ZoomInfo identifies a "Srikanta Gouda" as an Automation Developer at MUFG Pension & Market Services (possibly the same person, having moved firms)

**Assessment:** Srikanta Gouda was a Deutsche Bank employee involved in setting up or administering a derivatives account for Epstein. His appearances are focused on a narrow set of "New Derivatives account" setup emails. This is notable because the DFS enforcement action specifically flagged Deutsche Bank's failure to properly scrutinize Epstein's trading activity.

---

### 7. Jitan Patel
- **Appearances:** 92 redacted text fragments
- **EFTA Range:** [EFTA01358466](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01358466.pdf) -- [EFTA01412530](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01412530.pdf) (DB banking records)
- **Distinct Documents:** ~31 unique EFTA numbers
- **Role Determination:** **Deutsche Bank Compliance / KYC Staff**

**Evidence:**
- Appears alongside Rita Shteynberg, Mackinlay, Xavier Avila, Mathew Negu, Anthony Lentini, Nina Tona, David
- Key subject line: "Southern Financial LLC - KYC" -- KYC (Know Your Customer) compliance work
- Referenced regarding "SF [I] [C]" -- likely compliance flags or case references
- Handles "equities/convertible bonds" queries
- LinkedIn confirms a Jitan Patel at Deutsche Bank

**Assessment:** Jitan Patel appears to have been a Deutsche Bank compliance or KYC analyst working on client due diligence, including work related to "Southern Financial LLC." His appearance in these records suggests he may have been involved in compliance reviews of Epstein-related accounts or entities. The KYC subject line is particularly notable given Deutsche Bank's subsequent $150M fine for compliance failures regarding Epstein.

### 8. Gail F Mahabir
- **Appearances:** 49 redacted text fragments
- **EFTA Range:** [EFTA01370532](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01370532.pdf) -- [EFTA01435824](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01435824.pdf) (DB banking records)
- **Distinct Documents:** 27 unique EFTA numbers
- **Role Determination:** **Deutsche Bank PWM Operations / Deposit Processing**

**Evidence:**
- Almost exclusively appears in one recurring thread: "Subject: RE: Deposit Return - A/c # 35269691 *** Query for pwm returnItem [C]"
- Account number 35269691 is Epstein's primary Deutsche Bank account (ending xxx9691)
- Appears in large distribution lists with: Joy E Mitchell, Julian J Leff, Divya Rajawat, Stewart Oldfield, William-M Finn, Cynthia Rodriguez, CUST INV, Mariela Lopez, Norma A Kenney, Raphael A Marin, Muhammod J Uddin, Hemant-Kumar Rathore, Evon A Lawrence, Erna Menniti, Sara Castro, Theresa Coleman, Bradley Gillin, Anna E Del Rosso, Karen Groover, Renel Itile
- Her email appears to end in @db.com: "opwmbankingexceptioncheck@..." (partial)

**Assessment:** Gail F Mahabir was a Deutsche Bank PWM operations employee who handled deposit return queries on Epstein's account #35269691. The large team CC list suggests she was part of a group that investigated "pwm return items" -- deposits or transactions flagged by the system. Her repeated appearance on this specific account makes her a witness to the bank's processing of Epstein's financial activity.

---

## CATEGORY 2: EPSTEIN HOUSEHOLD STAFF / PROPERTY MANAGERS

These individuals worked directly for Jeffrey Epstein in his residences, on his island properties, or in property management roles.

---

### 9. Janusz Banasiak
- **Appearances:** 111 redacted text fragments
- **EFTA Range:** [EFTA01333133](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01333133.pdf) -- [EFTA02205890](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02205890.pdf) (broad range: banking, emails, court docs)
- **Distinct Documents:** ~40+ unique EFTA numbers
- **Role Determination:** **Epstein Property Manager / House Manager (KEY PROSECUTION WITNESS)**

**Evidence from the files:**
- Court/witness document: "She was paid $200.00 each time she went. Each time she went she was reminded not to speak of what..." ([EFTA01333133](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01333133.pdf), page 73) -- immediately followed by "is assigned to Janusz Banasiak"
- Email with personal email: "Janusz Banasiak [janusz53@me.com]"
- Emails with Jeffrey Epstein (jeevacation@gmail.com) and Karyna Shuliak
- Emails with Lesley Groff, Richard Barnett, Francis Derby -- all confirmed Epstein staff
- Cc'd with pilot Larry Visoski (lyjet@aol.com)
- DOJ records reference: "Moe, Alison (USANYS)" and "Young, Amanda Nicole" -- SDNY prosecutors
- Calendar entries: "Janusz to pick up" ([EFTA02169262](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA02169262.pdf))
- Referenced in connection with "FPL: Details on an upcoming..." (likely Florida Power & Light for Epstein's Palm Beach property)
- Appears alongside "FRANCIS T SNACKS" -- likely a vendor/service

**Publicly Known Information:**
- Polish national who immigrated to the U.S. in 1980
- Worked for Epstein as house/property manager for over 20 years, starting February 2005
- Ghislaine Maxwell first interviewed him for the position in December 2004
- Had access to safe passwords and alarm codes
- **KEY:** Jake Tapper (CNN) reported that Banasiak testified Epstein's assistant Adriana Mucinska Ross "and someone else were told before Palm Beach cops arrived to 'remove the multiple computers in the house'"
- Granted immunity / cooperation agreement in exchange for testimony against Epstein and Maxwell
- Was a prosecution witness in the Ghislaine Maxwell trial

**Assessment:** CRITICAL WITNESS. Janusz Banasiak is one of the most important witnesses in the Epstein case. His appearance in the files confirms his role managing Epstein's properties and his proximity to criminal activities. The [EFTA01333133](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01333133.pdf) document (page 73) is particularly significant -- it appears to be victim testimony about payments and being told not to speak, with his name directly attached. His cooperation with prosecutors was instrumental in the Maxwell conviction.

**FLAG: The document at [EFTA01333133](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01333133.pdf) page 73 connecting Banasiak to victim payments ($200) and instructions to maintain silence is a high-priority evidentiary document.**

### 10. Daphne Wallace
- **Appearances:** 124 redacted text fragments
- **EFTA Range:** [EFTA01457702](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01457702.pdf) -- [EFTA02285427](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02285427.pdf) (broad: contacts list, emails, operations)
- **Distinct Documents:** ~60+ unique EFTA numbers
- **Role Determination:** **Epstein Property Manager / USVI Operations Staff**

**Evidence from the files:**
- Appears in a massive contacts/distribution list ([EFTA01457702](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01457702.pdf)) alongside: Bella Klein, Ben Beller, Lesley Groff, Richard Kahn, DKIESQ Indyke (Darren Indyke), Elise Hubsher, customer support, investor services, and many known Epstein associates
- Cc'd on emails with Jeffrey Epstein (jeevacation@gmail.com)
- Cc'd with Lesley Groff (Epstein's executive assistant)
- Email subjects reveal operational role:
  - "Subject: Re: OK to change meeting w/A" with "Cecile de Jongh"
  - "Subject: Gary Moses" from "St Thomas" (USVI)
  - "Subject: FW: Dry Devil Mix" (a local USVI product/vendor)
  - "RE: Reservation Confirmation #89458658 for Frenchman's" (Frenchman's Reef resort, St. Thomas)
  - "Subject: Scott Graff" (with Jeanne Brennan)
  - "Subject: Steel building sheeting/gut" (construction/property management)
  - "Kern hangar" (aircraft hangar reference)
  - "JT & MH - St. John 3.19.2013" (calendar/scheduling for St. John island)
- Emailed with Brice Gordon, Arran McGinnis, Kenneth Holmes, Monique Harry, Carlos Rods
- Referenced alongside Jeannie, Myla Trestiza, Ken Holmes

**Publicly Known Information:**
- Named in subpoenas issued to Miles and Cathy Alexander (Epstein island managers) alongside Jeffrey Epstein, Ghislaine Maxwell, Bella Klein, Harry Beller, Lesley Groff, Sarah Kellen, Erika Kellerhals, Richard Kahn, and Darren Indyke
- Her inclusion in this subpoena group places her among the most significant operational figures in Epstein's USVI operations

**Assessment:** Daphne Wallace was a senior operational/property management figure in Epstein's U.S. Virgin Islands operations. Her responsibilities included managing construction projects (steel buildings), coordinating with local vendors ("Dry Devil Mix"), handling reservations, and communicating with other island staff. She appears on the same subpoena list as Epstein's top inner circle (Maxwell, Kellen, Groff, Indyke, Kahn), indicating she was considered a person with significant knowledge of island operations. Her role managing the USVI properties makes her a potentially important witness regarding activities on Little St. James and Great St. James islands.

**FLAG: Daphne Wallace's placement on the same subpoena list as Maxwell, Kellen, and Groff suggests prosecutors considered her a key operational figure.**

---

### 11. Jojo Fontanilla (and Lyn/Jun-Lyn Fontanilla)
- **Appearances:** 826 redacted text fragments (searching all "Fontanilla" variants)
- **EFTA Range:** [EFTA01344754](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01344754.pdf) -- [EFTA02291665](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02291665.pdf) (very broad: emails, schedules, staff lists)
- **Distinct Documents:** ~200+ unique EFTA numbers
- **Role Determination:** **Epstein House Manager / Driver (and wife Lyn as co-house manager)**

**Evidence from the files:**
- Appears alongside Lesley Groff in staff communications
- Scheduled with Jeffrey Epstein (jeevacation@gmail.com)
- Appears with "merwin dela cruz" -- another confirmed Epstein household staff member
- Email subjects: "Schedule Thurs Sept 26th", "Schedule Thurs Dec 3", "This morning"
- Referenced with Richard Barnett (Epstein property caretaker)
- Both "Jojo Fontanilla" and "Lyn Fontanilla" appear, indicating husband-wife team
- Personal email appears to be: "jofontanilla54@..."
- Also listed with Louella Rabuyo -- likely another household staff member
- Reconstructed page from [EFTA02112214](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA02112214.pdf) flagged as document_type "VICTIM_STATEMENT": "Jo'o fontanill, Lynn Fontanilla... can you girls figure out timing..."

**Publicly Known Information:**
- Luciano "Jojo" Fontanilla and Jun-Lyn (Lyn) Fontanilla were Filipino-American housekeepers for Epstein since the 1990s
- Esquire Philippines extensively documented their connection
- Listed in Epstein's black book
- Facebook photos showed them with Prince Andrew, Bill Clinton, Chris Tucker, John Kerry, Hilary Swank, Sarah Ferguson
- **Identified in court documents** as Epstein staff members "with knowledge of Defendant and Jeffrey Epstein's inappropriate conduct with underage girls"
- Appeared in Epstein's flight logs
- Also worked for Chris Tucker
- Their daughters were also employed by Epstein at various times

**Assessment:** IMPORTANT WITNESSES. The Fontanillas were Epstein's longest-serving household staff, working for him since the 1990s across his New York, Palm Beach, and other properties. Court filings specifically state they had "knowledge of...inappropriate conduct with underage girls." Their extremely high appearance count (826) reflects their central role in daily household operations. The reconstructed page flagged as a "VICTIM_STATEMENT" that mentions them coordinating timing is potentially significant.

**FLAG: Court documents explicitly state the Fontanillas had knowledge of inappropriate conduct with underage girls. Their 826 appearances make them among the most frequently mentioned individuals in the files.**

**[REVISIT UPDATE -- 9,893 Documents, FBI Documentation, Dedicated LLC]:** DS9/DS11 full-text reveals **9,893 distinct EFTA documents** (vs. 826 redaction hits). Key new findings:
- **FBI CID Intelligence Report** ([EFTA00129048](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00129048.pdf), page 3): "A photo, provided by Jun-Lyn Fontanilla in 2010, shows her and her husband Jojo standing with Jeffrey Epstein. Fontanilla indicated she and Jojo worked as Epstein's housekeepers." Contractors on the property were "sworn to secrecy about property details."
- **"Lyn & Jojo, LLC"** ([EFTA00082267](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00082267.pdf)): Epstein created a dedicated corporate entity named after them, held through Darren Indyke as nominee. Trust amendment directs transfer of entire membership interest to Luciano A. Fontanilla Jr. and Rosalyn Fontanilla.
- **Escalating trust bequests:** Early trust: $1M; 2014 amendment: $2M plus Lyn & Jojo LLC membership; Final trust: **$3M** to Luciano A. Fontanilla Jr. ([EFTA00099303](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00099303.pdf)). Loans to both Luciano and Rosalyn explicitly forgiven across all trust versions.

### 12. Brice Gordon (and Karen Gordon)
- **Appearances:** 60 redacted text fragments
- **EFTA Range:** [EFTA01681865](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01681865.pdf) -- [EFTA02208044](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02208044.pdf) (emails, operations)
- **Distinct Documents:** ~59 unique EFTA numbers
- **Role Determination:** **Epstein Island Manager / Ranch Manager (DISAPPEARED)**

**Evidence from the files:**
- Direct email correspondence with Jeffrey Epstein (jeevacation@gmail.com)
- Emailed with Daphne Wallace, Arran McGinnis, Richard Kahn, Bella Klein
- Correspondence with Kenneth Holmes (Epstein property staff)
- Subject: "DryDevil Mix" (from Monique Harry, to Brice Gordon, cc Jeannie, Daphne Wallace) -- island supplies
- Subject: "Kern hangar" -- aircraft hangar management
- Subject: "Igor; Brice Gordon" -- referenced alongside someone named Igor
- Correspondence with Gary Kemeny (likely another property contact)
- Personal email: "brice gordon" used lowercase format, suggesting personal gmail
- One entry ([EFTA01681865](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01681865.pdf), page 12) marked: "Brice Gordon (S)" -- the "(S)" designation may indicate a legal status marker

**Publicly Known Information:**
- Brice and Karen Gordon are a New Zealand couple
- Former New Zealand Defence Force members
- Managed Epstein's Zorro Ranch in New Mexico, then later managed Little Saint James (LSJ) island
- A 2011 EPA permit listed Brice Gordon as "island manager" for Little St. James
- In 2011, Epstein granted Brice Gordon limited power of attorney for New Mexico affairs
- In a 2016 email, Gordon described LSJ as his and Karen's "new home"
- **After Epstein's death (August 2019) and Maxwell's arrest (July 2020), the Gordons are no longer publicly traceable**
- No confirmed current address in the US or New Zealand
- No social media presence
- Locals speculate they relocated to New Zealand

**Assessment:** Brice and Karen Gordon managed two of Epstein's key properties -- the New Mexico ranch and Little Saint James island. As island managers, they would have had direct knowledge of activities on the island. Their grant of power of attorney from Epstein in 2011 indicates a high level of trust. The "(S)" notation next to Gordon's name in one document may indicate a legal status or designation. Their current whereabouts are unknown.

**FLAG: Brice and Karen Gordon are no longer publicly traceable. As island managers with power of attorney, they would be significant potential witnesses. The FBI interview in 2007 ([EFTA00269597](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00269597.pdf)) confirms they were known to investigators.**

**[REVISIT UPDATE -- 7,428 Documents, FBI Interview, Employment Details]:** DS9/DS11 full-text corpus reveals **7,428 distinct EFTA documents** mentioning Brice Gordon (vs. 60 redaction hits in original). Key new findings:
- **FBI FD-302 Interview** ([EFTA00269597](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00269597.pdf), DS9): Transmission memo dated 02/15/2007 confirms Gordon was formally interviewed by the FBI at 49 Zorro Ranch Road, Stanley, NM on 02/08/2007 in case 31E-MM-108062 (JEFFREY EPSTEIN; GHISLAINE N. MAXWELL -- WSTA-CHILD PROSTITUTION). After the interview, "Santa Fe RA considers this lead covered."
- **Employment start date:** April 15, 2003, confirmed by Lee McKenzie Consulting vacation records ([EFTA00305481](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00305481.pdf)). Vacation: 6 weeks/year plus 12 statutory holidays.
- **Trust bequest:** $200,000 conditional on 2 years of post-death service ([EFTA00082267](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00082267.pdf)). His disappearance likely forfeited this bequest.
- **Active through July 2018:** DS11 emails show Gordon managing Great St. James island development with architects John Heah (Thames Wharf) and French firm 3BIS as late as May-July 2018 -- one year before Epstein's arrest, not merely post-death.
- Email signatures: "Brice Gordon / The Saint James Group / USVI," personal email: bgordon@nysgmail.com, also bgordon.lsj@gmail.com; Zorro Ranch email: zdc.rt41@gmail.com (Zorro Development Corp).

### [REVISIT] Bella Klein -- Reclassified from Household Staff to Senior Financial Operative

**[REVISIT UPDATE]:** Bella Klein was mentioned in the original report only in passing (subpoena lists, contact lists). DS9/DS11 full-text reveals **11,810 distinct EFTA documents** -- establishing her as one of the most documented individuals in the corpus.
- **FBI SAR Investigation Subject** ([EFTA00128664](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00128664.pdf), July 2021): Klein flagged alongside Erika Kellerhals and IGO Company by the SAR Review Team (USAO USVI, IRS, DEA, DHS OIG).
- **Russia wire transfer contact** ([EFTA00128809](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00128809.pdf)): Designated contact for a **13.7 million Russian ruble wire** to AO Raiffeisenbank, Moscow (March 27, 2015).
- **FBI Maxwell associate identification** ([EFTA00150926](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00150926.pdf), December 2019): Identified as "Bella Kline" in list of individuals associated with Maxwell.
- **Trust bequests:** $500K (2014 trust) escalating to **$3M** (final trust).
- **Political donor:** $2,600 to USVI Congresswoman Stacey Plaskett in 2014.
- **Credit limit authority:** Signed Colonial Bank letters adjusting credit limits for other staff ([EFTA00186431](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00186431.pdf)).
- Klein was not "household staff" but a senior financial operative: signatory on 10+ entity bank accounts, wire authorization contact, and subject of post-mortem financial investigation.

### [REVISIT] Valdson Contrin -- Victim Transport Evidence

**[REVISIT UPDATE]:** Valdson Contrin (also "Cotrin," "Collin") was briefly mentioned in the original report's staff distribution lists. DS9/DS11 full-text reveals **4,347 distinct EFTA documents** and critical new evidence:
- **Direct victim transport** ([EFTA00145606](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00145606.pdf), page 3): A victim statement places Valdson on a Continental Airlines flight 1884, **December 30, 2006**, Newark to St. Thomas, traveling alongside the victim to 301 E. 66th Street and then to Little Saint James. The victim states: "This confirms that I was housed in one of Epstein's residences, where most rape survivors were housed."
- **Credit card with 100% cash advance access** ([EFTA00186431](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00186431.pdf)): Multiple Colonial Bank/NES LLC faxes show Epstein set up Valdson with corporate cards from December 2001, with cash advance access at 100% of card limit -- highly unusual for household staff.
- **Trust bequest:** **$5M** ([EFTA00099303](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00099303.pdf)) -- the highest bequest to any non-Visoski staff member, exceeding the $3M given to Klein, Fontanilla, and Dela Cruz.
- Contact records confirm his base in Paris/France.
- His categorization requires reassessment from "household staff" given the documented presence on the same flight as a victim traveling to Epstein's properties. Whether he had knowledge of the trafficking activity is not established in the released documents.

### 13. Leon Botstein
- **Appearances:** 80 redacted text fragments
- **EFTA Range:** [EFTA01789360](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01789360.pdf) -- [EFTA02203662](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA02203662.pdf) (emails, calendars, scheduling)
- **Distinct Documents:** ~79 unique EFTA numbers
- **Role Determination:** **President of Bard College; Epstein Social Associate and Donation Recipient**

**Evidence from the files:**
- Emails sent via "President Leon Botstein" <cluiggi@bard.edu> -- Catherine Luiggi was Botstein's executive assistant at Bard College
- Subject lines referencing "Jeffrey Epstein" directly in correspondence
- Calendar entries: scheduling phone calls, breakfasts, meetings between Botstein and Epstein
- "8:30 breakfast with Jeffrey Epstein" -- personal dining meetings
- "Alert - 2:00pm Go See Leon Botstein's concert" -- cultural events
- "Message from Leon Botstein's office" -- repeated scheduling threads (November 2012)
- Dates range from September 2012 through at least 2018
- "manager contacts for Simon Graichy" -- networking/introductions
- Correspondence through assistant Catherine Luiggi, suggesting a maintained professional relationship
- Reconstructed pages show: "Epstein Botstein" and scheduling for "tomorrow" with "Janusz Banasiak" and "FRANCIS T SNACKS" -- Banasiak coordinating Botstein's visits

**Publicly Known Information:**
- Leon Botstein has been President of Bard College since 1975
- Bard received an unsolicited $75,000 donation and 66 laptops from Epstein in 2013
- Botstein personally received $150,000 from Epstein in 2016 (claims he donated it to Bard)
- Emails show meetings between Botstein and Epstein from 2012-2016, contact through 2018
- **December 2012: Botstein had plans to visit "Epstein Island" (Little Saint James)**
- **2013: Botstein hosted Epstein and five "girls" at Bard College**
- 2018 emails show Botstein's assistant arranging repayment for a $56,000 Patek Philippe watch
- Botstein maintains the relationship was strictly about securing donations

**Assessment:** Leon Botstein maintained a years-long personal relationship with Jeffrey Epstein spanning at least 2012-2018 — years after Epstein's 2008 conviction. Public reporting indicates he (a) planned to visit Epstein's island, (b) hosted Epstein with five "girls" at Bard, (c) accepted a $56,000 luxury watch, and (d) received $150,000 personally. The 80 appearances in the database files confirm sustained scheduling and correspondence. Note: the island visit and "five girls" claims come from public reporting, not directly from the database records audited here.

**FLAG: Botstein's documented relationship with Epstein warrants further scrutiny given the public reporting about planned island visits and Epstein's visits to Bard with young women.**

### 14. Annette Siegal / Peggy Siegal / Gary Siegal (Combined Entry)
- **Total "Siegal" Appearances:** 200 redacted text fragments
  - Peggy Siegal: 45 appearances
  - Annette Siegal: 70 appearances
  - Gary Siegal: 26 appearances
  - Siegal Estate references: 41 appearances
  - Other Siegal (Jasper): 1 appearance
- **EFTA Range:** [EFTA01742550](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01742550.pdf) -- [EFTA02570943](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02570943.pdf) (emails spanning 2009-2017+)
- **Role Determination:** **Three separate Siegal individuals, all connected to Epstein**

**Annette Siegal:**
- Primary references are "Annette Siegal's estate" -- indicating she was deceased by 2013
- Email chain: "Subject: RE: Phil Michaels/Annette Siegal's estate" ([EFTA01750365](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01750365.pdf))
- Extended email chain "Re: Fwd: Fw: Annette Siegal's estate" with many participants including Gary Siegal
- Dates of estate correspondence: March 2013
- Epstein appears to have been involved in managing or advising on this estate

**Gary Siegal:**
- "Gary Siegal - Jeffrey Epstein" ([EFTA01975809](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01975809.pdf)) -- direct personal connection
- "Gary Siegal's Lawyers" -- a recurring subject line
- "Any news on Gary Siegal?" and "Gary Siegal - ANY NEWS" -- suggests monitoring of Gary's situation
- "ReplyTo: Gary Siegal" in estate-related emails

**Peggy Siegal:**
- "Peggy Siegal" <peggysiegal.com> -- her publicist website domain
- Correspondence from 2009 through at least 2015
- Subjects: "Midnight in Paris" (2011 Woody Allen film), "Jeffrey Epstein - check for Gotham" (magazine), "RE:" various scheduling
- Named with Meggie Cramer, Shapiro, Stephanie -- Hollywood/PR contacts
- Appears alongside "Dick Merkin" (possibly Richard Merkin, known Epstein associate)

**Publicly Known Information:**
- Peggy Siegal is a prominent entertainment publicist who orchestrated Epstein's rehabilitation campaign
- She was tasked by Epstein with enlisting Arianna Huffington to discredit Virginia Giuffre
- Her clients (Netflix, FX) dropped her in 2019 when the relationship became public
- Recent files reveal Epstein asked her to "neutralize" critical journalists

**Assessment:** The "Siegal" entries in the files encompass three distinct individuals. Peggy Siegal is a known Epstein fixer in the entertainment/media world. Annette Siegal appears to be a deceased person whose estate was of interest to Epstein. Gary Siegal appears to be Annette's relative (possibly husband) whom Epstein was monitoring ("any news?"). The "Phil Michaels/Annette Siegal's estate" thread suggests Epstein may have been involved in estate administration or had a financial interest. The interconnection of all three Siegals with Epstein warrants mapping their family relationships.

### 15. Barry Josephson
- **Appearances:** 10 redacted text fragments
- **EFTA Range:** [EFTA01756725](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01756725.pdf) -- [EFTA02040370](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA02040370.pdf) (emails, calendar)
- **Distinct Documents:** 9 unique EFTA numbers
- **Role Determination:** **Hollywood Producer; Close Personal Friend of Epstein**

**Evidence from the files:**
- Calendar entry: "3:00 TENTATIVE Appt w/Barry Josephson" ([EFTA01764399](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01764399.pdf))
- Emails exchanged with Epstein (jeevacation@gmail.com) and Richard Kahn
- Email with reference to escrow company: "site: www.sterlingwestescrow.com" ([EFTA01756725](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01756725.pdf)) -- real estate transaction
- "Google Alert - barry josephson" -- Epstein set up Google alerts monitoring Josephson
- Email: "barry.josephson@jo..." (likely josephsonentertainment.com)
- Contact information shared: "Barry Josephson [Josephson]" ([EFTA01952774](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01952774.pdf))

**Publicly Known Information (from recent DOJ file releases):**
- Former Columbia Pictures VP of Production (Bad Boys, Men in Black, Air Force One, The Fifth Element)
- Executive Producer of TV series "Bones" (2005-2017)
- Regularly corresponded with Epstein about young women
- **In 2013, Epstein asked Josephson to find "actresses interested in riding on his jet to L.A."**
- **Josephson replied about "casting girls for my pilot" and invited Epstein to "stop by my office :)"**
- Epstein insisted on getting certain young women cast in projects
- Epstein provided Josephson $120,000 in 2011 and helped with a $215,000 tax bill in 2013
- The Google Alert on Josephson's name suggests Epstein was monitoring his public profile
- Claimed "I knew nothing about him" despite evidence of close friendship through at least 2018

**Assessment:** Barry Josephson's relationship with Epstein extended well beyond casual acquaintance. The documented financial flows ($120K loan + $215K tax assistance), the exchanges about young women and "casting girls," and the sustained correspondence through 2018 indicate a sustained personal relationship. The real estate escrow reference in the files may indicate additional financial entanglement. His relatively low appearance count (10) belies the significance of the documented content.

**FLAG: Josephson's documented exchanges about "casting girls" and finding "actresses" for Epstein's jet warrant scrutiny given Epstein's documented history. Whether these exchanges represent innocent industry conversation or something more is not established in the released documents.**

**[REVISIT UPDATE -- 1,013 Documents, 100x Expansion]:** DS9/DS11 full-text reveals **1,013 distinct EFTA documents** (vs. 10 redaction hits). Key new findings:
- **Katherine Langford Google search** ([EFTA02643545](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02643545.pdf), July 8, 2017): Josephson emailed Epstein a Google search link for Katherine Langford, then a 20-year-old Australian actress newly famous for Netflix's "13 Reasons Why." The context of sending a link about a young actress to a convicted sex offender is notable given the previously documented "casting girls" exchanges, though it could also be routine entertainment industry conversation.
- **"Katherine Khaut" assistant candidate** ([EFTA02537492](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02537492.pdf) / [EFTA00436660](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00436660.pdf), March 2011): Josephson sent a young woman named Katherine Khaut as an "Assistant Candidate" to Epstein. Staff email: "Barry Josephson's girl" -- Epstein's immediate response: "ask her to come today."
- **Woody Allen/Soon-Yi dinner circle:** Repeated dinners at 9 East 71st Street with Woody Allen and Soon-Yi (October 2016, March 2017). Epstein said "no" when asked if Soon-Yi could have Josephson's contact info ([EFTA00317504](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00317504.pdf)).
- **Calendar appointments:** 7+ years of systematic scheduling (2011-2018), including same-day appointments with Leon Black, Thorbjorn Jagland (Nobel Committee chair), and John Brockman.
- The relationship was far more deeply embedded than the original 10-hit count suggested.

## CATEGORY 4: SELF-PROCLAIMED WHISTLEBLOWER

---

### 16. George B. Tonks
- **Appearances:** 212 redacted text fragments
- **EFTA Range:** [EFTA01651983](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01651983.pdf) -- [EFTA01653098](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01653098.pdf) (concentrated in ~21 documents)
- **Distinct Documents:** 21 unique EFTA numbers
- **Role Determination:** **Self-proclaimed whistleblower; convicted felon; controversial public figure**

**Evidence from the files:**
The Tonks documents are NOT typical Epstein file records. They are **screenshots of social media posts** (Twitter/X, Instagram, OnlyFans) compiled into PDF documents, likely as part of legal monitoring or evidence collection. This is a distinctive format.

**Key content from Tonks' social media posts preserved in the files:**

1. **Whistleblower Claims:**
   - "A federal judge stated that I cannot be interviewed without the court's permission. I have decided to turn down all interview requests."
   - "What case were you a witness on and what governmental agency granted you whistleblower status? No one can find it." (This is a challenge from Lady Victoria Hervey)
   - Posts reference "questioning & additional polygraph testing proving any of my claims. Call next: 708-252-4880"

2. **Epstein/Wexner Connection Claims:**
   - "There is nothing wrong with me for forgiving Leslie Wexner. I have moved on from what happened over 40 years ago." -- implies personal victimization by Wexner decades ago
   - References to "The FBI, Department of Justice, Joe Biden & the du Pont family"
   - Claims about emails "between Hunter Biden & Henri du Pont"

3. **Accusations Against Other Victims:**
   - Posts call Virginia Giuffre and Maria Farmer "con artists" and says "we have the proof"
   - "RENT GIRLS & BOYS LIVING THE GOOD LIFE IS NOT SEX TRAFFICKING!"
   - Referenced in context of "Exposing Maria Farmer" (Jessica Reed Kraus article)

4. **Personal Status:**
   - "THE PARTY STARTS SOON! I will be off of federal probation & will be living between New York, London & Miami."
   - "The 2000's I lived in my beautiful penthouses between New York, San Francisco & Miami"
   - References to "ENEMIES GET READY!"
   - "Everyone must follow my OnlyFans page"

5. **Criminal Record:**
   - United States v. George Tonks, No. 08-3821 (8th Circuit, 2009) -- a federal criminal case
   - He was on federal probation
   - Lady Victoria Hervey (who also appears) calls him a "felon" and questions his whistleblower status

6. **Interactions with Known Figures:**
   - "Lady Victoria communicates with Ghislaine & I can only say that there is a lot going on behind the scenes"
   - Engagement with Lucia Osborne-Crowley (journalist covering Maxwell trial)
   - Referenced alongside Jessica Reed Kraus (HouseInHabit/Substack)
   - Posts about "shady dealings" and journalists @JD_Cashless, @SoniaPoulton, @khadeeja_safdar

**Document Classification in reconstructed_pages:**
- Variously classified as "FBI_REPORT", "VICTIM_STATEMENT", "LEGAL", "EMAIL", "OTHER"
- These classifications appear system-generated and misleading -- the content is social media screenshots

**Publicly Known Information:**
- Appeared on Shaun Attwood's True Crime Podcast alongside Maria Farmer
- Claims to have been a victim of Wexner's (40+ years ago)
- Self-proclaimed whistleblower with unverified status
- Has a federal criminal conviction (8th Circuit, 2009)
- Active on social media making claims about Epstein network
- Accused of stalking and hacking by others in the survivor community

**Assessment:** George B. Tonks is a controversial and unreliable figure on the periphery of the Epstein case. He claims whistleblower status but this has been challenged publicly and no verification has been found. He has a federal criminal conviction. His posts simultaneously claim to support victims while calling Giuffre and Farmer "con artists." His claims about Leslie Wexner victimizing him "over 40 years ago" are unverified. The files contain his social media output rather than any substantive legal or investigative documentation. His 212 appearances are an artifact of multi-page social media screenshot compilations rather than genuine document frequency.

**CAUTION: Tonks' material should be treated with extreme skepticism. His inclusion in the files appears to be for monitoring/documentation purposes rather than as substantive evidence.**

## CATEGORY 5: INSTITUTIONAL / ORGANIZATIONAL CONNECTIONS

### 17. Hasty Pudding
- **Appearances:** 31 redacted text fragments
- **EFTA Range:** [EFTA01749448](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01749448.pdf) -- [EFTA02210344](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02210344.pdf) (emails, 2012-2017)
- **Distinct Documents:** 28 unique EFTA numbers
- **Role Determination:** **Harvard's Hasty Pudding Theatricals; recipient of Epstein donations**

**Evidence from the files:**
- Multiple email threads: "Subject: Re: Jeffrey Epstein/Hasty Pudding Event in NY"
- "Subject: Fwd: Hasty Pudding Gala - Listing and Table" ([EFTA01940417](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01940417.pdf))
- "Subject: Hasty Pudding Gala 4/11/16" -- with Marie-Cecile Girard-Jones ([EFTA02057096](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA02057096.pdf))
- "Subject: Hasty Pudding Gala - T..." (multiple emails, 2015)
- "Subject: Hasty Pudding Order of the Golden Sphinx" (2017) -- a donor recognition tier
- "Jeffrey has purchased a table of 8 for this Hasty Pudding BLACK TIE event" ([EFTA02207854](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02207854.pdf))
- Karyna Shuliak and Erin Cunningham CC'd on "Jeffrey Epstein/Hasty Pudding" correspondence
- "Subject: The Hasty Pudding In..." ([EFTA02203218](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA02203218.pdf)) -- likely "Institute"

**Key Details:**
- Event dates: 2015 Gala, April 11, 2016 Gala, 2017 Golden Sphinx event
- Epstein purchased full tables (8 seats) at black-tie events
- Correspondence involved Karyna Shuliak (Epstein's girlfriend) and Erin Cunningham (staff)
- "Order of the Golden Sphinx" is the highest donor recognition level

**Publicly Known Information:**
- Epstein donated at least $225,000 to Hasty Pudding (more than previously known)
- Donations made through Jeffrey Epstein Virgin Islands Foundation and Gratitude for America
- Annual $50,000 donations from 2014-2019
- Qualified for "Guardian of the Sphinx" tier
- Andrew L. Farkas (Hasty Pudding board chairman, Harvard 1982) had separate business relationship with Epstein including a Virgin Islands marina joint venture
- After the 2016 donation became public, Hasty Pudding donated $50,000 to an anti-trafficking nonprofit

**Assessment:** The Hasty Pudding connection is a documented channel for Epstein's institutional philanthropy and social rehabilitation after his 2008 conviction. The files confirm Epstein personally attended black-tie galas (purchasing tables of 8), brought associates (Karyna Shuliak), and achieved the highest donor recognition level. The Harvard connection facilitated Epstein's access to academic and social prestige. The Farkas connection (board chairman with Epstein business ties) suggests the donations were not truly "unsolicited" as Harvard claimed.

### 18. Jabwcpa Gmail (JABWCPA@GMAIL.COM)
- **Appearances:** 290 redacted text fragments
- **EFTA Range:** [EFTA01381066](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01381066.pdf) -- [EFTA01788635](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01788635.pdf) (DB banking records and account reports)
- **Distinct Documents:** ~150+ unique EFTA numbers
- **Role Determination:** **Jeffrey Epstein's Personal CPA/Accountant (Email: jabwcpa@gmail.com)**

**Evidence from the files:**
- Email format: "JABWCPA@GMAIL.COM" -- "JAB" likely initials, "W" possibly middle initial, "CPA" = Certified Public Accountant
- Always listed in account report distribution lists:
  - "Jabwcpa Gmail (Email), Pinedo (Email), [Cothron], Paul Morris, Fx Rates:, [Vahe Stepanian] (Email)"
  - "JABWCPA@GMAIL.COM; Amanda Kirby" (DB staff)
- Received FX Rates reports, account valuations, and financial summaries
- Appears alongside Richard Kahn (Epstein's known accountant) in some distributions
- High appearance count (290) indicates they received every routine account report from Deutsche Bank
- The "CPA" designation in the email address confirms this is a Certified Public Accountant
- Listed in a contact list alongside both Deutsche Bank staff and Epstein's personal contacts

**Analysis of "JAB" Initials:**
- The DFS enforcement action against Deutsche Bank references "ACCOUNTANT-1" who communicated with the bank about Epstein's accounts
- "JAB" could represent the initials of this accountant (first name, middle initial, last name beginning with B)
- The gmail.com domain (not a firm domain) suggests this was either a personal email or a small/solo CPA practice
- The account was receiving the same automated reports as DB internal staff, indicating authorized client-side access

**Assessment:** JABWCPA@GMAIL.COM is almost certainly the personal email of Epstein's CPA -- the individual referred to as "ACCOUNTANT-1" in regulatory documents. This person received every financial report Deutsche Bank generated for Epstein's accounts, including FX rates, valuations, and transaction summaries. The "JAB" initials could help identify this individual. Given the DFS enforcement action noted that ACCOUNTANT-1 played a role in the account opening process and communications with the bank, identifying this individual by name would be significant.

**[REVISIT UPDATE -- IDENTITY FULLY CONFIRMED]:** DS11 emails definitively resolve this identity. JABWCPA@GMAIL.COM is **Jeanne Anne Brennan Wiebracht** (maiden/hyphenated: Brennan-Wiebracht). The initials "JAB" = **J**eanne **A**nne **B**rennan. Confirmation sources:
- [EFTA02349173](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02349173.pdf) (DS11): Email from "Jeanne" using jabwcpa@gmail.com
- [EFTA02353230](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02353230.pdf) (DS11): Full name "Jeanne Brennan Wiebracht" using jabwcpa@gmail.com
- [EFTA00165940](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00165940.pdf) (DS9): Driver's license: "BRENNAN-WIEBRACHT, JEAN ANNE"
- [EFTA00168946](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00168946.pdf) (DS9): DB KYC record listing occupation as "Novice," USVI resident

Her role was far more extensive than "CPA receiving reports." She was a **signatory on 10+ Epstein entity bank accounts** at Colonial Bank/JPMorgan ([EFTA00065864](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00065864.pdf)), including IGO Company LLC, Lafayette Contractors LLC, Southern Trust Company Inc, Freedom Air Petroleum LLC, and Thomas World Air LLC (this account was frozen). She held **full Power of Attorney over Deutsche Bank accounts** ([EFTA00169398](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00169398.pdf)), and processed monthly staff salary authorizations directly with Epstein. She was a central financial gatekeeper in the Epstein organization.

## KEY INVESTIGATIVE RECOMMENDATIONS

### Highest Priority (CRITICAL)

1. **Brice and Karen Gordon** -- As island managers who are no longer publicly traceable, they would be significant witnesses to island activities. The 2007 FBI interview ([EFTA00269597](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00269597.pdf)) confirms they were already known to investigators.

2. **Barry Josephson** -- The documented emails about "casting girls" and finding "actresses" for Epstein's jet warrant further scrutiny. The $335,000 in financial assistance from Epstein documents a significant financial relationship. The 2018 correspondence contradicts his public claims of ignorance about Epstein's activities.

3. **Janusz Banasiak** -- The document at [EFTA01333133](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01333133.pdf) page 73 connecting him to $200 victim payments and instructions to maintain silence should be preserved and cross-referenced. His cooperation agreement and testimony transcripts should be fully analyzed.

4. **Jojo and Lyn Fontanilla** -- Court documents explicitly state they had knowledge of "inappropriate conduct with underage girls." Their 826 appearances reflect their central operational role. Their potential testimony about decades of household operations is invaluable.

### High Priority

5. **JABWCPA@GMAIL.COM** -- Identify this person using CPA licensing databases and the "JAB" initials. This individual received all financial reports for Epstein's Deutsche Bank accounts.

6. **Jitan Patel** -- As a DB compliance/KYC analyst who worked on client due diligence, he may have specific knowledge of what compliance reviews were conducted (or not conducted) on Epstein's accounts.

7. **Daphne Wallace** -- Her inclusion on the same subpoena list as Maxwell, Kellen, and Groff indicates she was considered a key operational figure. Her role managing USVI property operations deserves deeper investigation.

8. **Leon Botstein** -- His planned visit to Epstein's island and hosting of Epstein with five "girls" at Bard College require further scrutiny, as does the $56,000 Patek Philippe watch.

9. **Peggy Siegal** -- Her role as Epstein's media fixer attempting to "neutralize" journalists and discredit victims is well-documented but the full scope of her activities in the files may reveal additional rehabilitation schemes.
