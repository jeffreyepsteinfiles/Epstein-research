# LEAD 1: ALEXANDER BROTHERS (ALON, OREN, TAL)

## 1a. Primary Document: [EFTA01660651](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01660651.pdf) -- NTOC Tips Compilation

### Document Overview
[EFTA01660651](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01660651.pdf) is an FBI National Threat Operations Center (NTOC) tips compilation document. It is a multi-page spreadsheet-style compilation of tips received by the FBI from the public, with columns for tip content, named persons of interest, FBI follow-up actions, and criminal history checks. The email chain carrying this document is dated **August 6-7, 2025** and was circulated internally with the subject line "FW: NTOC Names" / "RE: NTOC Names."

### The Alexander Brothers Tip -- FULL TEXT

**Source:** [EFTA01660651](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01660651.pdf), pages 0 and 3 (two formatting versions of the same tip)
**Database IDs:** record #742675 (page 0) and id 742688 (page 3)
**Confidence:** 0.99

**Tip Summary (page 0, compact format):**

> "At age 16, while modeling, caller attended 8 parties at Epstein's New York residence. On one occasion, caller reported she was sexually assaulted by Epstein. On another occasion, two twin brothers, Allen and Oren, lured caller and her friend upstairs but they escaped back downstairs. Caller stated Oren raped her best friend and a third brother, Tal, raped a 14 year old girl named Katie LNU. Caller named other individuals involved in 'big orgy parties' with her, other young girls, and older Victoria's Secret models, including Bill Clinton and Donald Trump."

**FBI Annotation (sidebar/Notable Names column, page 3 expanded version):**

> "Allen, Oren, Tal (LNU, possibly identifiable as Alexander brothers)"
> "Epstein's 'British Socialite'"
> "Bill Clinton"
> "Donald Trump"
> "Jeffrey Epstein"

**FBI Follow-Up Column for this tip:** "None" -- no documented follow-up action.

### Key Analytical Notes on the Tip

1. **"Allen" = "Alon"**: The caller used the Anglicized form "Allen" for what is actually "Alon" -- a common transliteration of the Hebrew name. The FBI correctly tentatively matched this.

2. **"LNU" notation**: The FBI annotated "LNU" (Last Name Unknown) for the three brothers, indicating the caller did not provide a surname. The FBI's analytical annotation "possibly identifiable as Alexander brothers" shows they conducted some level of identification analysis.

3. **"At age 16, while modeling"**: The caller was a teenage model, consistent with the known profile of Epstein's victims (modeling industry pipeline, Victoria's Secret connection).

4. **"8 parties at Epstein's New York residence"**: Multiple visits to the 9 East 71st Street townhouse.

5. **"big orgy parties"**: Describes large-scale sexual events involving "other young girls, and older Victoria's Secret models."

### Duplicate Document: [EFTA01660679](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01660679.pdf)

A near-identical version exists at [EFTA01660679](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01660679.pdf) (pages 0 and 3), with minor OCR variations. This version is dated "Thursday, August 7, 2025 11:41:01 AM" and has subject "RE: NTOC Names." The email chain shows:

- Page 0 header: "bject: RE: NTOC Names"
- Page 3 header: "Wednesday, August 6, 2025 4:00 PM" (original send)
- Page 5 header: "bject: NTOC Names" (original subject)

Previously, the companion document [EFTA01660679](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01660679.pdf) was reported to contain an attachment "NTOC - Alexander Brothers.pdf" with an FBI Child Exploitation agent requesting the "full NTOC report" to "interview regarding the Alexander brother allegations." In this search, the relevant email header fragments are partially recovered (pages 0, 3, 5) but the specific attachment reference and CEHTF agent request text were not re-extracted in full from the redaction database. The agent request is documented in the prior session's investigation report.

**Category 2: Eileen Alexanderson (Epstein associate/employee) -- 3,548+ records (DS9/DS11 full corpus)**
Eileen Alexanderson appears in 3,548 documents across DS9/DS11, overwhelmingly in Epstein's daily calendars as a member of the Leon Black financial team. Representative calendar entries include "Appt w/Eileen Alexanderson and team at Leon Black's" ([EFTA00284747](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00284747.pdf)), "JE to Go See Eileen Alexanderson and Ada Clapp at Leon Black's" ([EFTA00284793](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00284793.pdf)), and "Black Family Meeting: Larry Delson, Rich Joslin, Eileen Alexanderson, Ada Clapp, Rich D'Agostino, Heather Gray, Alan Dlugash, Rich Kahn, Darren" ([EFTA00284982](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00284982.pdf)). One entry ([EFTA00299816](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00299816.pdf)) mentions "Katie Newman and August Sangovese" as "Eileen Alexanderson's people" -- this "Katie" is a colleague, NOT the victim "Katie LNU" from the Alexander brothers tip. Alexanderson is NOT connected to the Alexander brothers; the surname overlap is a coincidence. Key observations from earlier databases:
- Email: jeevacation@gmail.com (an Epstein email domain)
- Regularly corresponds with: Lesley Groff (Epstein's executive assistant), Jeffrey Epstein, Richard Joslin, Ada Clapp, Heather Gray, Melanie Spinella
- One record ([EFTA02137987](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA02137987.pdf), id 1628841): "leen Alexanderson* 05/23/2013 07:53 -- 2:30 Jeffrey Epstein meeting" -- scheduling Epstein meetings
- One record ([EFTA02147265](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA02147265.pdf)): "Eileen Alexanderson at her office" -- she had an office
- Entity: elysllc.com email domain visible ([EFTA02097966](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA02097966.pdf)) -- connected to Elysium Management LLC (Leon Black's family office entity)
- Connected to: [EFTA02128454](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA02128454.pdf) -- email to Melanie Spinella from Alexanderson

**Category 3: R. Alexander Acosta (U.S. Attorney) -- 15+ records**
- [EFTA01718407](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01718407.pdf), page 17: "Meeting (US: Alexander Acosta)" -- 2007 meeting reference
- Multiple appearances in Non-Prosecution Agreement documents ([EFTA00013680](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00013680.pdf), [EFTA00013739](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00013739.pdf), [EFTA00014110](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00014110.pdf), etc.)
- Single unique EFTA with "Alexander Acosta" in redactions: [EFTA01718407](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01718407.pdf)

**Category 4: Alexander Rossmiller (SDNY Prosecutor) -- 2 records**

### Redaction Analysis DS10 Database (532MB)
Duplicates the v2 results exactly. Same [EFTA01660651](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01660651.pdf) and [EFTA01660679](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01660679.pdf) entries. No additional unique Alexander brothers references.

### OCR Database (68MB)
Alexander Acosta dominates: 15,000+ characters across 20+ documents relating to the NPA.
Additional:
- [EFTA02571050](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02571050.pdf)/[EFTA02570929](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02570929.pdf): Alexander Scriabin quotes in Ben Goertzel email signatures -- irrelevant
- [EFTA00037094](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00037094.pdf): "Harriet Alexander" (journalist) -- irrelevant
- [EFTA02730477](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2012/EFTA02730477.pdf): FBI research on "Roderic Alexander Hamilton, a Person of Interest for Alleged Defense Witnesses in the Ghislaine Maxwell Trial" -- separate investigation, not the Alexander brothers
- [EFTA00038950](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00038950.pdf): "JUDKA, ALEXANDER L." at CBP DHS -- Alexander Judka, a CBP witness
- [EFTA00038817](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00038817.pdf): "Rossmiller, Alexander (USANYS)" -- the SDNY prosecutor

### Image Analysis Database (20K images)
- [EFTA00001728](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%201/EFTA00001728.pdf): Employee list including "Kevin Alexander -- Houseman & Extra help" at Little St. James island
- **No images of the Alexander brothers**

### Knowledge Graph Database
- **Alexander Fekkai**: Person, auto-created from flight logs. Traveled with Frederic Fekkai (celebrity hairstylist) and Audrey Blaise
- **No entries for Oren, Tal, Alon, or "Alexander brothers"**

## 1c. Individual Name Searches: Allen/Alon, Oren, Tal

### "Oren" with relevant context
Only hits: [EFTA01660651](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01660651.pdf) and [EFTA01660679](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01660679.pdf) (the NTOC tips). Zero other documents mention "Oren" in any Epstein-related context.

### "Tal" with relevant context
Only hits: [EFTA01660651](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01660651.pdf) and [EFTA01660679](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01660679.pdf). No standalone relevant references.

### "Alon" / "Allen"
"Allen" is too common for targeted search (Amanda L. Allen at FBI, Woody Allen, etc.). "Alon" yields zero relevant hits beyond the NTOC tip.

**Finding: The Alexander brothers appear in 3 EFTA numbers: [EFTA01660651](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01660651.pdf) and [EFTA01660679](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01660679.pdf) (the same NTOC document in two versions), plus [EFTA01207741](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA01207741.pdf) -- a browser screenshot from a seized device showing someone browsing Oren Alexander's photo page on BFA.com (a society photography site), specifically a photo from the 22nd Annual Watermill Center Summer Benefit (July 25, 2015). The browser tabs in the screenshot include "Inspiring Capital" and French-language settings ("Accueil"), indicating the user may be associated with that venture platform. Two additional EFTA documents reference BFA.com in Epstein's network: [EFTA00850564](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00850564.pdf) (Epstein emailing a BFA.com link about a "russian girl from moscow" attempting to "blackmail a group of powerful biznessman in New York") and [EFTA01198259](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA01198259.pdf) (another seized-device Firefox screenshot browsing BFA.com). BFA.com is a widely used society photography site, and browsing it does not inherently indicate surveillance activity. However, the presence of Oren Alexander's photos on a seized Epstein device, combined with the separate "russian girl" blackmail email, documents that BFA.com content was accessed within Epstein's network.**

## 1d. "Katie" as Victim Reference

### "Katie LNU" Search
Only hits: [EFTA01660651](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01660651.pdf) pages 0 and 3 -- the NTOC tip itself.

### "Katie" with victim context (rape, 14, victim, girl, LNU)
- [EFTA01660651](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01660651.pdf)/[EFTA01660679](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01660679.pdf): The primary reference -- "Tal raped a 14 year old girl named Katie LNU"
- [EFTA00028106](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00028106.pdf): "Katielynn Boyd Townsend ktownsend@rcf" -- legal professional, not a victim
- **No other victim named Katie identified in any database**

**Finding: "Katie LNU" remains unidentified. "LNU" (Last Name Unknown) confirms the FBI had no surname for this 14-year-old victim at time of tip.**

## 1e. FBI Follow-Up Documents

### Search for Follow-Up
- **Zero FBI 302 (interview) documents** referencing the Alexander brothers
- **Zero case management documents** referencing them
- The NTOC tip shows "None" in the follow-up column

### NTOC Document Chain
The NTOC compilation circulated via internal FBI email August 6-7, 2025. Three separate versions of a "PROMINENT NAMES" briefing also exist ([EFTA01656173](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01656173.pdf), [EFTA01656152](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01656152.pdf), [EFTA01656198](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01656198.pdf), [EFTA01660622](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01660622.pdf)) -- these are 17-page FBI briefing summaries. The Alexander brothers do NOT appear in any Prominent Names briefing -- they appear only in the raw NTOC tips compilation.

The Prominent Names briefings do contain a line: "*Numerous anonymous NTOC's were received with allegations against prominent individuals." This generic reference is the only acknowledgment of NTOC tips in the formal briefing documents.

- Max Wanger (Los Angeles wedding/commercial photographer -- different person)
- Paul Wandtke (ex-Trivium drummer)
- Anna Wandtke (violinist)
- Terrence R. Wandtke (author)
- A "wandke-photography" account on ViewBug.com and 500px.com (note: "Wandke" without the 't' -- possibly related?)

### "Max Wandtke" CD Evidence
**Zero relevant results.** No connection to evidence or legal proceedings found.

## 2e. Cross-Reference: [EFTA00004348](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%203/EFTA00004348.pdf) -- "Max" in Another Binder

OCR text ([EFTA00004348](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%203/EFTA00004348.pdf)): "Max in snow2.JPG", "Max in snow5.JPG", "Max in snow0.JPG", "Max in snow1.JPG" -- photos of "Max" in snow

**Assessment:** This "Max" attended Epstein's 50th birthday (January 20, 2003), was photographed with someone named "Paula" at a pool (likely LSJ island), and had personal snow photos stored on the same CD. The CD also contains LSJ aerial photos and 727 airplane photos.

**Whether this "Max" is the same person as "Max Wandtke" in [EFTA00004800](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%203/EFTA00004800.pdf) cannot be determined from the available data.** The binders are separate evidence collections. However, the co-occurrence of a "Max" in personal photo CDs at Epstein's events across two different evidence binders is notable.

## 2f. Flight Logs, Contact Lists, DS10 Emails

- **Zero** "Wandtke" in flight logs (knowledge graph)
- **Zero** "Wandtke" in DS10 emails
- **Zero** "Wandtke" in any contact list or address book
- **Zero** "Wandtke" in financial records

**Assessment: Max Wandtke is a complete ghost in the Epstein files. The name appears on one handwritten CD label in an evidence binder that also contains CSAM-flagged material (pages 20, 79) and redacted "model" photos (pages 15-16). The CD itself was among "2 CDs" that the preceding page (8) noted were "NOT SCANNED." It is unknown whether the FBI ever examined the contents of this particular CD.**

# LEAD 3: NORTH SALEM WEDDING

## 3a. Primary Evidence: [EFTA00004800](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%203/EFTA00004800.pdf), Pages 88-96

### Binder Cover Reference
Page 1 of [EFTA00004800](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%203/EFTA00004800.pdf) lists "WEDDING/TUCKER/N SALEM" as one of the content categories. Full-text corpus search of DS9 reveals the complete folder label is actually **"North Salem/Kidd Wedding/Tucker"** (visible in [EFTA00245479](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00245479.pdf), [EFTA00245481](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00245481.pdf), and [EFTA00245483](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00245483.pdf)), adding the surname **"Kidd"** to identify the wedding couple or family.

### Knowledge Graph
- **Steve Tuckerman** (person, from flight logs): Traveled on Epstein flights
- **Judy Tuckerman** (person, from flight logs): Traveled on Epstein flights
- No entity named simply "Tucker"

**Assessment:** The "Tucker" on the binder cover cannot be definitively matched to any known individual. Chris Tucker flew on Epstein's plane but no evidence connects him to a North Salem wedding. The Tuckermans appear in flight logs. Now that the full folder label is known to be "North Salem/Kidd Wedding/Tucker" and the property is identified as the Dubin estate, "Tucker" most likely refers to a guest, family member, or the photographer associated with the wedding event itself -- not Chris Tucker, Tucker Carlson, or the Tuckermans from flight logs. The identity remains unresolved but is contextually narrowed.

## 3d. "LSJ" Reference Context

The binder cover abbreviation "LSJ" appears extensively across the corpus and stands for **Little St. James** -- Epstein's private island:

Key OCR references:
- [EFTA00037340](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00037340.pdf): "FBI/NYPD team will reach Little St James (LSJ) and execute the search warrant"
- [EFTA00020141](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00020141.pdf): "photographs appear to be labeled with file names that include 'LSJ,' which I believe stands for Little St. James"
- [EFTA00003046](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%201/EFTA00003046.pdf)/[EFTA00003056](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%201/EFTA00003056.pdf): "LSJE, LLC" -- corporate entity for island operations
- [EFTA00004577](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%203/EFTA00004577.pdf): "LSJ girls -- Girls dancing18.JPG Girls dancing19.JPG..."
- [EFTA00026890](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00026890.pdf)/[EFTA00015786](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00015786.pdf): "FBI did not prepare an inventory of their evidence when they seized it from NY and LSJ"

Within [EFTA00004800](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%203/EFTA00004800.pdf) specifically:
- Page 47 (image #4815): DVD labeled "MISCLSJ" (Miscellaneous Little St. James)
- Page 54 (image #4823): DVD with "LSJ" text visible

**This confirms the evidence binder contains material from multiple Epstein locations: LSJ (island), PB (Palm Beach), and N. Salem (North Salem wedding).**

## 3e. North Salem Property Identified: Glenn and Eva Dubin, 12 June Road

**CORRECTION (full-text corpus revisit, 2026-02-12):** The original investigation found no Epstein-owned property in North Salem and no specific Epstein associate owning property there. The full-text corpus of DS9/DS11 definitively identifies the property as the **Glenn and Eva Dubin estate at 12 June Road, North Salem, NY.**

### Epstein Email Regarding Deposition About "Young Girls" at North Salem

[EFTA00825777](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00825777.pdf) (DS9) contains an email from Epstein to Glenn Dubin, June 13, 2016:

> *"fyi. renaldo. gave a depo and said i brought young girls on multiple occassions to north salem. nonsense but i thought you shoudl know"*

Glenn Dubin's reply ([EFTA00825780](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00825780.pdf)), 2 minutes later:

> *"uuugghh"*

Duplicate copies exist in DS11 at [EFTA02459952](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02459952.pdf) and [EFTA02460024](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02460024.pdf).

Epstein explicitly acknowledges that a deposition has been given alleging he brought "young girls on multiple occasions" to the Dubins' North Salem property. Epstein dismisses this as "nonsense." Dubin's single-word response — "uuugghh" — expresses displeasure but is ambiguous; it could reflect frustration at the allegation, concern about its implications, or any number of reactions. The exchange does not establish whether Dubin had knowledge of the alleged conduct.

### "Renaldo" Identified as Eva Dubin's Staff Member

The "Renaldo" who gave the deposition was Eva Dubin's household staff member:

- [EFTA02552296](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02552296.pdf) (DS11): Lesley Groff to Epstein (March 19, 2012): *"Please confirm it is ok for Renaldo, eva's staff person, to stay at the PB house staff quarters. He would be alone and just sleep there. He knows not to go into the kitchen. March 23-25"*
- [EFTA01212224](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA01212224.pdf) (DS9, iMessage March 18, 2019): Epstein texts: *"renaldo a real creep"* -- Response: *"He is the worst!!!"*

Renaldo had access to both the Dubins' properties and Epstein's Palm Beach house. He later gave deposition testimony stating Epstein brought young girls to North Salem.

### Janusz Banasiak: Epstein Staff Placement at Dubin Property

Multiple emails show Epstein placing his own employee Janusz Banasiak at the Dubins' North Salem property:

| EFTA | DS | Date | Content |
|------|-----|------|---------|
| [EFTA00630164](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00630164.pdf) | 9 | Jul 29, 2016 | Epstein to Eva: "would you consdier taking janusch and his wife for north salem" |
| [EFTA00636112](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00636112.pdf) | 9 | Jul 29, 2016 | Eva reply: "Yes! But I don't think they want to move from Florida...." |
| [EFTA01058566](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA01058566.pdf) | 9 | Dec 23, 2016 | Epstein: "do you want janusch for north salem?" |
| [EFTA01058334](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA01058334.pdf) | 9 | Dec 27, 2016 | Eva: "interested in exploring Janusz and Ofelia taking a couples position in North Salem" |

[EFTA00040278](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00040278.pdf) (DS9) is a 7-page FBI 302 interview of Janusz Banasiak (October 19, 2021). Banasiak was Epstein's Palm Beach house manager (2005-2016+). Key excerpt: *"When EPSTEIN would arrive with the girls BANASIAK would try to give them space or privacy so he wouldn't answer as many phone calls during that time."* The emails document Epstein recommending his own employee — who separately told the FBI he witnessed Epstein "arriving with girls" — for a position at the Dubins' North Salem property. Whether this recommendation had any purpose beyond ordinary employment placement is not established by the available documents.

### Kevin Vanacore / Old Salem Farm

[EFTA00309497](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00309497.pdf) (DS9) contains the resume of Kevin F. Vanacore, who was Property Manager at Old Salem Farm, North Salem, NY from 1994-1998. Documents show Epstein interviewed Vanacore via Skype in June 2012 for a property management position.

### Lesley Groff Hiring Caretaker for Dubins' Property

[EFTA00396552](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00396552.pdf) (DS9) shows Lesley Groff (Epstein's assistant) emailing about a "Caretaker for South Salem" position (January 31, 2013) for Eva Dubin, demonstrating Epstein's staff was directly involved in hiring for the Dubins' household. (South Salem is the hamlet directly adjacent to North Salem.)

## 3f. Geographic Anomaly

Image analysis of page 92 noted "views of a body of water, including a lighthouse and a ship." North Salem is landlocked. This could indicate:
1. The wedding CD also contains photos from a different location
2. The property has views of nearby reservoirs (Titicus Reservoir, Cross River Reservoir)
3. The "ship" and "lighthouse" descriptions may be decorative elements

## Lead 1 and Leads 2/3 Connection Status

The Alexander brothers (Lead 1) appear in NTOC tips documents ([EFTA01660651](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01660651.pdf)/[EFTA01660679](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01660679.pdf)) and in the Oren Alexander browser screenshot ([EFTA01207741](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA01207741.pdf)). No direct connection between the Alexander brothers and the Dubin North Salem property has been established. The Alexander brothers tip describes events at "Epstein's New York residence" (9 East 71st Street), not North Salem. However, the Oren Alexander screenshot shows someone in Epstein's network browsing his society photos, and the brothers' luxury real estate business operated in the same social circuit as the Dubins. Both the Alexander brothers tip and the North Salem evidence involve allegations of bringing young women/girls to social events.

The connection between Leads 2 (Wandtke) and 3 (North Salem) is now substantially strengthened: the North Salem wedding photos were taken at the Glenn and Eva Dubin property, where deposition testimony alleges Epstein brought "young girls on multiple occasions," and where Epstein recommended his own employee Banasiak — who separately told the FBI he witnessed Epstein "arriving with girls" — for a household position.

## "Max" Across Binders

A person named "Max" appears in:
1. **[EFTA00004800](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%203/EFTA00004800.pdf), page 9:** "Max Wandtke" CD
2. **[EFTA00004348](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%203/EFTA00004348.pdf):** "JE 50 Bday, Max, 727" -- with "Max & Paula" photos and "Max in snow" photos at Epstein's 50th birthday and LSJ island

Whether these are the same person cannot be confirmed.

# RECOMMENDATIONS

## Lead 1: Alexander Brothers -- HIGH PRIORITY

1. **Trial Relevance (ACTIVE):** The Alexander brothers are currently on trial in Manhattan federal court on sex trafficking charges. They have pleaded not guilty to all counts. An NTOC tip in [EFTA01660651](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01660651.pdf) alleges their presence at Epstein's NY parties and alleges sexual assaults. NTOC tips are unverified public tips to the FBI and do not constitute findings of fact. The tip's relevance to the current prosecution is for investigators and the court to evaluate.

2. **Pattern Allegation:** The tip alleges a pattern — brothers working in concert at social events — that is similar to the pattern charged in the current case (2008-2021). If the tip's allegations are accurate, they would extend the alleged conduct back to the late 1990s/early 2000s. The tip is unverified and the brothers have not been charged in connection with the Epstein investigation.

3. **Katie LNU Identification:** The 14-year-old victim "Katie LNU" remains unidentified. If she was 14 in the late 1990s, she would be approximately 40 years old now. Her identity may be known to prosecutors but is not in the released files.

4. **FBI Follow-Up Gap:** No documented follow-up exists for this tip. An FBI Child Exploitation agent previously requested the full report to "interview regarding the Alexander brother allegations" -- the outcome of that request is unknown.

5. **Redaction Failure:** DOJ redaction failures initially exposed identifying information about the victim who made this tip, leading to a temporary file takedown. This should be investigated as a potential witness safety issue.

## Lead 2: Max Wandtke -- IDENTITY UNKNOWN

1. **Complete Ghost:** Max Wandtke appears nowhere in the Epstein files except on one CD label. No emails, travel records, financial records, phone records, or other references exist.

2. **CD Contents Unknown:** The CD was photographed but its data contents are not characterized in any database. Page 8 indicates the surrounding CDs were "NOT SCANNED."

3. **Proximity Concern:** The CD is in the same binder section as CSAM-flagged material (pages 20, 79) and redacted "model" photos (pages 15-16). The contents warrant investigation.

4. **[EFTA00004348](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%203/EFTA00004348.pdf) Cross-Reference:** The "Max" in the "JE 50 Bday, Max, 727" binder should be cross-referenced. "Max & Paula" photos at the LSJ pool could help identify this individual.

5. **Web Identity:** No public figure named "Max Wandtke" could be identified. The "wandke-photography" accounts on photo-sharing sites (without the 't') may be worth investigating.

## Lead 3: North Salem Wedding -- PROPERTY IDENTIFIED, WEDDING PARTIALLY RESOLVED

1. **Property Identified:** The North Salem property is the **Glenn and Eva Dubin estate at 12 June Road, North Salem, NY**. The Dubins are extensively documented Epstein associates (54+ documents in original databases, thousands in DS9/DS11, 34+ flights, "lent out" prosecution testimony).

2. **Wedding Identified as "Kidd Wedding":** Full-text corpus reveals the folder label is "North Salem/Kidd Wedding/Tucker" -- the surname **Kidd** identifies the wedding couple or family.

3. **"Tucker" Identity Narrowed:** In the context "North Salem/Kidd Wedding/Tucker" at the Dubin estate, "Tucker" most likely refers to a guest, family member, or photographer associated with the wedding -- not Chris Tucker, Tucker Carlson, or the Tuckermans.

4. **Deposition Allegation:** [EFTA00825777](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00825777.pdf) documents Epstein informing Glenn Dubin that a staff member (Renaldo) gave deposition testimony alleging Epstein "brought young girls on multiple occasions to north salem."

5. **Staff Connections:** Epstein recommended his own Palm Beach house manager (Janusz Banasiak) for a position at the Dubins' North Salem property, and Epstein's assistant (Lesley Groff) was directly involved in hiring household staff for the Dubins.

6. **Video Evidence:** Three AVI video files from the wedding exist. These may contain audio and clearer identification of attendees than the blurred still photos.

7. **Scale of Documentation:** 105+ photos from 3 cameras plus 3 videos indicates this was a significant event warranting extensive documentation.
