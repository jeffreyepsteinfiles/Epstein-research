## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

The DOJ Epstein files reveal a deep, multi-year, multi-dimensional relationship between Jeffrey Epstein and the Edmond de Rothschild banking dynasty -- particularly Ariane de Rothschild (Baroness, CEO of Edmond de Rothschild Group) and her late husband Benjamin Edmond de Rothschild (died January 15, 2021, age 57, heart attack).

Key findings from the databases:

1. **Ariane de Rothschild used a personal email channel** (aderfam.ch domain) to communicate with Epstein from at least **June 2013** through December 2018 -- with three distinct prefixes (`ader@`, `perso@`, and `adr@`). The April 2015 email ([EFTA02502971](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02502971.pdf)) announced a new address within the domain, not the creation of the channel itself. The earliest known aderfam.ch email is [EFTA00657588](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00657588.pdf) (DS9, June 19, 2013).
2. **$24,999,980 flowed from Rothschild entities to Epstein's Southern Trust Company** in December 2015 -- split across two wires ($10M from Edmond de Rothschild (Suisse) SA Geneva on 12/17/2015, and $14,999,980 from Benjamin Edmond de Rothschild personally on 12/21/2015).
3. **The wire coincided exactly** with the DOJ Swiss Bank Program settlement on December 18, 2015, where Edmond de Rothschild (Suisse) paid $45M in penalties for helping US clients hide undeclared assets.
4. **Epstein introduced Kathy Ruemmler** (former Obama White House Counsel) to the Rothschilds, and she helped negotiate the DOJ non-prosecution agreement while simultaneously maintaining close personal ties to Epstein.
5. **Epstein served as intermediary** between Ariane de Rothschild and Ehud Barak (former Israeli PM), channeling investments into Israeli cyberweapons/surveillance startups (Carbyne/Reporty). DS9 now contains the complete Reporty Homeland Security corporate articles ([EFTA00583654](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00583654.pdf)), Series A term sheets ([EFTA00585234](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00585234.pdf)), and bridge financing agreements ([EFTA00583689](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00583689.pdf)), confirming Barak's entity invested $1.5M for 25%+ ownership.
6. **Deutsche Bank processed all wire transfers** and maintained an extensive internal email thread titled "Rothschild [C]" and "Rothschild - Being shown an offer!" tracking the account activity.
7. **Olivier Colom**, an Edmond de Rothschild executive, was in close personal contact with Epstein and served as a network conduit to European political figures including Bruno Le Maire and Nicolas Sarkozy.

Ariane: "CAN't Call as B si majorly f***ed up at the House. The girls are afraid, Mimi in a total rage against Him."

Ariane: "Yes I will discuss it with the doctor this morning." |
| March 2, 2014 | [EFTA02395020](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02395020.pdf) | Epstein to Ariane | "Im aware that not rocking the boat is the strategy for today. the plan would be to have things ready to go.

### Significance Analysis

1. **Deliberate OPSEC:** The CEO of a major Swiss bank explicitly told a convicted sex offender that she had created an email address "that nobody can access." The domain confirmed elsewhere is **aderfam.ch** -- a personal/family domain, not an Edmond de Rothschild corporate address. DS9 reveals the aderfam.ch channel was operational from **at least June 2013** ([EFTA00657588](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00657588.pdf), a bounce-back email containing Epstein's letter: "shared with me 30 years ago has acted as a compass for my business life") -- nearly two years earlier than the April 2015 email that announced a new address within the domain. Three distinct prefixes were used: `ader@aderfam.ch`, `perso@aderfam.ch` (from at least January 2018), and `adr@aderfam.ch`. The full corpus contains **176+ aderfam.ch emails** spanning June 2013 through December 2018 ([EFTA02311949](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02311949.pdf)).

2. **Timing:** April 2015 -- approximately 5 months before the signing of the $25M consulting agreement (dated September 2015 per [EFTA00310331](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00310331.pdf)), and 8 months before the December 2015 wire transfers of $25M from Rothschild entities to Epstein's Southern Trust.

3. **"Ade Rothschild-2":** The sender name indicates this was her SECOND email account set up specifically for Epstein correspondence -- further confirming compartmentalization of the communication channel. The earlier `ader@aderfam.ch` account was the primary address used from 2013 onward.

4. **Content Reveals Intimate Relationship:** Ariane discusses:
   - Her husband Benjamin's erratic behavior ("keep his attitude. Unsustainable")
   - Potential divorce from Benjamin
   - Real estate interests (Michael Douglas property)
   - Daughter Noemie's visit schedule
   These personal disclosures to Epstein — who had been convicted in 2008 — indicate a relationship extending well beyond professional consulting.

5. **Evasion of Corporate Oversight:** Using aderfam.ch rather than edmond-de-rothschild.com ensured that:
   - Edmond de Rothschild compliance departments could not monitor communications
   - Swiss financial regulators could not access the exchanges
   - DOJ investigators would have difficulty discovering the channel through standard subpoena routes

## 3. THE $25 MILLION WIRE TRACE

### Source Document: [EFTA00027019](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00027019.pdf) -- "EXHIBIT A: LEON BLACK / ROTHSCHILD GROUP TRANSACTIONS"

This DOJ prosecution exhibit documents all wire transfers through Epstein's Deutsche Bank accounts. The Rothschild transactions appear in the final section:

### December 2015 Wire Transfers

| Date | Payer | Recipient | Amount | Bates # |
|------|-------|-----------|--------|---------|
| 12/17/2015 | **Edmond de Rothschild (Suisse) SA Geneva, Switzerland** | Southern Trust Company, Inc. | **$10,000,000** | DB-SDNY-0005122 |
| 12/18/2015 | Black Family Partners, LP | Southern Trust Company, Inc. | $10,000,000 | DB-SDNY-0005122 |
| 12/21/2015 | **Benjamin Edmond de Rothschild** | [Southern Tru]st Company, Inc. | **$14,999,980** | DB-SDNY-0005122 |
| 12/30/2015 | Leon and Debra Black c/o Apollo Management | [Southern Tru]st Company, Inc. | $10,000,000 | DB-SDNY-0005123 |

### Total Rothschild Inflow: $24,999,980

- **$10,000,000** from the institutional bank (Edmond de Rothschild Suisse SA)
- **$14,999,980** from Benjamin de Rothschild personally
- Combined: **$24,999,980** (~$25M as specified in the consulting agreement)

### The Consulting Agreement (September 2015)

The complete 6-page "Letter of Agreement" is now available at [EFTA00310331](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00310331.pdf) (DS9):

- **Parties:** Southern Trust Company, Inc. (Epstein, President) and Edmond de Rothschild Holding S.A. (Ariane de Rothschild, representative). Ariane signed both personally AND as representative of EdR Holding SA.
- **Scope:** "Risk analysis and estate planning matters" plus "algorithms" -- collectively "Specified Matters"
- **Tiered Fee Structure (Section 2(b)):**
  - **$10,000,000** if DOJ penalty was between $75M and $150M
  - **$25,000,000** if DOJ penalty was $75M or less
- **Payment trigger:** Within 30 days of final DOJ settlement
- **Additional terms:** Reimbursement of all travel and out-of-pocket expenses; full indemnification of Epstein/STC; explicit disclaimer that the agreement did NOT constitute investment advice; USVI governing law, USVI courts
- **Outcome:** The actual DOJ penalty was $45M -- well under the $75M threshold -- triggering the maximum $25M fee. This tiered structure incentivized Epstein to minimize the DOJ penalty, aligning his financial interests with the Rothschild bank's. Given that Ruemmler — who was introduced to the Rothschilds by Epstein — was simultaneously the DOJ-facing negotiator, this arrangement raises conflict-of-interest questions.

### The DOJ Settlement Connection (December 18, 2015)

**Critical timing sequence:**

1. **December 17, 2015:** Edmond de Rothschild (Suisse) SA wires $10M to Southern Trust
2. **December 18, 2015:** Edmond de Rothschild (Suisse) SA enters **non-prosecution agreement** with DOJ under the Swiss Bank Program, paying **$45 million penalty** for helping US clients hide billions in undeclared assets
3. **December 21, 2015:** Benjamin Edmond de Rothschild personally wires $14,999,980 to Southern Trust

**The payment trigger in the consulting agreement explicitly stated:** payment within three days after the Rothschild Group completed its payment to US authorities. The December 17 wire preceded the December 18 DOJ settlement by one day, and the December 21 personal wire followed it by three days -- exactly matching the contractual payment trigger.

### Downstream Disposition of Rothschild Funds

After receiving the ~$25M, Epstein's Southern Trust Company distributed funds to:

**Investment/Hedge Funds (from Exhibit B):**
| Date | From | To | Amount |
|------|------|----|--------|
| 3/1/2016 | Southern Financial LLC | Boothbay Absolute Strategies Fund LP | $10,000,000 |
| 3/31/2016 | Southern Financial LLC | Boothbay Absolute Strategies Fund LLP | $5,000,000 |
| 5/31/2016 | Southern Trust Company | Honeycomb Partners LP | $20,000,000 |

**Via The Haze Trust / Plan D, LLC (from Exhibit D):**
| Date | From | To | Amount |
|------|------|----|--------|
| 1/8/2016 | The Haze Trust (DB Brokerage) | [Transfer] | $20,000,000 |
| 3/27/2017 | The Haze Trust DBAGNY | Plan D, LLC Checking | $15,000,000 |
| 3/31/2017 | BV70 LLC | Plan D, LLC | $22,500,000 |

**Other Notable Outflows from Epstein's SuperNow Accounts (Exhibit C):**
| Date | To | Amount |
|------|----|--------|
| 11/13/2015 | Kellerhals Ferguson Kroblin PLLC | $23,000,000 |
| 1/8/2016 | The Haze Trust (DB Brokerage) | $20,000,000 |

The Rothschild funds were comingled with Leon Black's payments and distributed through Epstein's complex web of entities.

## 4. RUEMMLER "EXAGGERATING ABOUT BENJAMIN" -- FULL CONTEXT

### Source Document: [EFTA02513986](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02513986.pdf)

**Date:** Monday, January 12, 2015, 9:17 AM
**From:** jeffrey E. (jeevacation@gmail.com)
**To:** Kathy Ruemmler

**Full Reconstructed Text:**

Kathy Ruemmler wrote first:
> "had assumed you were exaggerating a bit about Benjamin. Wrong assumption."

Epstein responded:
> "simon; I have no first hand knowledge I've never met, his father 30 years ago knew a problem was in the future"

### Analysis

1. **Ruemmler had personal knowledge of Benjamin de Rothschild:** The phrase "Wrong assumption" indicates she had recently met or observed Benjamin and discovered that Epstein's warnings about his behavior were accurate -- likely after a dinner or meeting arranged by Epstein.

2. **"His father 30 years ago knew a problem was in the future":** Epstein references Edmond Adolphe de Rothschild (1926-1997), Benjamin's father, who founded the bank. This indicates Epstein's relationship with the Rothschild family dated back to approximately 1985 -- to the generation before Ariane and Benjamin.

3. **The "simon" reference** is cryptic -- possibly a code name or an intermediary who also had concerns about Benjamin.

4. **Context from [EFTA02395020](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02395020.pdf) (March 2014):** In emails one year earlier, Ariane told Epstein: "CAN't Call as B[enjamin] majorly f***ed up at the House. The girls are afraid, Mimi in a total rage against Him...and I'm about to give up on it all as my brain is about to explode with anguish." Epstein responded: "He is in a deeply sliding curve and nothing seems to stop him. I'm also afraid for our Security as he doesn't know what he is doing."

5. **Joint Calendar Entry ([EFTA02075023](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA02075023.pdf)):** "Appt w/Kathy & Ariane" confirms Ruemmler and Ariane de Rothschild met jointly with Epstein -- likely the meeting where Ruemmler observed Benjamin's behavior firsthand.

### Ruemmler's Dual Role

Kathy Ruemmler occupied an extraordinary position in this network:

- **Former Obama White House Counsel** (2011-2014)
- **Latham & Watkins Partner** representing Edmond de Rothschild in the DOJ Swiss Bank Program investigation -- introduced to the client by Epstein
- **Close personal associate of Epstein** (dozens of meetings 2014-2019)
- **Named as backup executor** in Epstein's January 2019 will
- **Goldman Sachs General Counsel** (current position)

She simultaneously:
1. Represented the Rothschild bank in DOJ negotiations
2. Maintained an intimate advisory relationship with Epstein
3. Had direct personal knowledge of Benjamin de Rothschild's erratic behavior
4. Met jointly with Ariane de Rothschild and Epstein

Whether this refers specifically to the $25M consulting agreement or another matter is not established from the subject lines alone. The "[C]" designation indicates confidential classification.

## 6. BENJAMIN DE ROTHSCHILD'S DEATH AND TIMING

### The Death

**Benjamin Edmond Maurice de Rothschild** died on January 15, 2021, at his home in Pregny-Chambesy, Switzerland. Cause of death: heart attack. Age: 57.

### Key Timeline

| Date | Event |
|------|-------|
| ~1985 | Epstein's relationship with Rothschild family begins (per his reference to Benjamin's father knowing "a problem was in the future" 30 years ago) |
| 1997 | Benjamin inherits Edmond de Rothschild Group after father Edmond Adolphe de Rothschild's death |
| March 2014 | Ariane describes Benjamin's violent episodes to Epstein ("majorly f***ed up at the House. The girls are afraid") |
| January 2015 | Ruemmler confirms Benjamin's behavior to Epstein ("Wrong assumption") |
| April 2015 | Ariane creates untraceable email to Epstein; discusses divorcing Benjamin |
| September 2015 | $25M consulting agreement signed between Southern Trust and EdR Holding SA ([EFTA00310331](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00310331.pdf); exact day left blank in signature block) |
| December 17, 2015 | $10M wire from EdR (Suisse) SA to Southern Trust |
| December 18, 2015 | DOJ non-prosecution agreement with EdR (Suisse) -- $45M penalty |
| December 21, 2015 | $14,999,980 wire from Benjamin personally to Southern Trust |
| July 6, 2019 | Epstein arrested in New York |
| August 10, 2019 | Epstein found dead in Metropolitan Correctional Center |
| **January 15, 2021** | **Benjamin de Rothschild dies of heart attack, age 57** |
| 2021 | Ariane de Rothschild becomes Chairman of Edmond de Rothschild Group |
| March 2023 | Ariane becomes CEO, first non-Rothschild by blood to lead a Rothschild institution |
| January 2026 | DOJ Epstein Files released, revealing the full scope of the relationship |

### Investigative Significance of Benjamin's Death

1. **Benjamin died 17 months after Epstein** -- he can never be deposed or questioned about the $14,999,980 personal wire to Southern Trust.
2. **Both principals to the $25M transaction are dead** -- Epstein (August 2019) and Benjamin (January 2021).
3. **Only Ariane de Rothschild remains** as a living signatory to the consulting agreement and a witness to the full scope of the relationship.
4. **Benjamin's erratic behavior** documented in the emails ("majorly f***ed up," "deeply sliding curve," "doesn't know what he is doing") raises questions about his capacity to authorize the $14.9M personal wire and whether Ariane was the actual decision-maker.

---

## 7. ARIANE DE ROTHSCHILD'S ROLE IN THE RELATIONSHIP

### Current Position
- **Chairwoman and CEO**, Edmond de Rothschild Group (since 2023)
- First person without Rothschild lineage to run a Rothschild-branded financial institution
- Oversees approximately $175 billion in assets under management

### Her Role as Documented in the Files

**1. Primary Point of Contact (Not Benjamin):**
All personal email exchanges in the databases are between Epstein and Ariane, not Benjamin. She was the one who:
- Created the untraceable email channel ([EFTA02502971](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02502971.pdf))
- Discussed tax avoidance strategies ([EFTA02362043](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02362043.pdf))
- Shared intimate family details with Epstein
- Signed the $25M consulting agreement as representative of EdR Holding SA

**2. Discussed Divorcing Benjamin with Epstein:**
"At the going rate, We should seriously consider separating/divorcing -- would make my life much happier" (April 2015). This reveals Epstein as trusted personal adviser to Ariane, not merely a financial consultant.

**3. Tax Strategy Discussions:**
In the November 2014 exchange ([EFTA02362043](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02362043.pdf)), Ariane and Epstein discussed:
- PWC Luxembourg leak of 28,000 documents on fiscal rulings
- Portugal's 10-year tax-free residency program
- The UBS case ending in acquittal ("a good balance")
- Ariane was traveling to meet Epstein at his NY house, staying at The Mark hotel

**4. Medical/Health Advisory Role:**
- In March 2014, Ariane said she would "discuss it with the doctor this morning" after Epstein's guidance
- In January 2017, Epstein sent her an article about statins causing nightmares -- suggesting he monitored her (or Benjamin's) health

**5. Coordinated with Ruemmler:**
The joint calendar entry "Appt w/Kathy & Ariane" ([EFTA02075023](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA02075023.pdf)) confirms all three met together. The subject of the meeting is not specified in the calendar entry.

**6. Edmond de Rothschild Corporate Email:**
The [EFTA02518347](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02518347.pdf) email between Epstein and Olivier Colom bears the full Edmond de Rothschild (France) legal boilerplate, demonstrating that communications flowed through official bank channels as well as personal ones.

### The aderfam.ch Domain

The "new email address that nobody can access" used the domain **aderfam.ch**:
- "adr" = Ariane de Rothschild
- "fam" = family
- ".ch" = Switzerland
- Confirmed in [EFTA01802148](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01802148.pdf): email forwarded to "A. de Rothschild <adr@aderfam.ch>"

This was a personal Swiss-registered domain outside all corporate oversight, regulatory monitoring, and standard legal discovery pathways.

---

## 8. THE EHUD BARAK / ISRAELI CYBERWEAPONS DIMENSION

Per public reporting (DropSite News, November 2025), the $25M paid to Epstein's Southern Trust was connected to a broader scheme:

1. Epstein acted as intermediary between Ariane de Rothschild and former Israeli PM Ehud Barak
2. In January 2014, Epstein arranged a dinner in Paris with Ariane, Barak, and Nicolas Sarkozy
3. Epstein advised Barak on managing the Rothschild relationship: provide "time, attention, stable, recurring, predictable" engagement
4. The Southern Trust entity that received the $25M was the same entity used to fund Barak's security startup **Reporty Homeland Security** (later renamed **Carbyne**)
5. Barak's ventures explored offensive hacking tools and surveillance systems targeting cell phones, routers, and the Tor network

### The Rothschild-Barak Pipeline

## 9. OLIVIER COLOM -- THE ROTHSCHILD INSIDER

### Profile
- Former French diplomat, part of Nicolas Sarkozy's circle
- Moved to Edmond de Rothschild private bank
- In close personal contact with Epstein from at least 2013
- DS9/DS11 expanded the Colom documentation from 3 documents to **329 unique documents** (173 in DS9, 156 in DS11), revealing Colom as a deeply embedded member of Epstein's network

### Key Communications

**[EFTA02518347](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02518347.pdf) (July 27, 2014):**
Colom to Epstein, during personal crisis:
> "Thanks. I am in a very strange state: depressed, hopeful, humiliated but determined to keep my wife. All that at various levels depending time, circumstances etc. Worst time in my life so far."

Epstein responded:
> "understood. you might want to take an afternoon in the countryside at a minimum to get some distance. I find it really helps"

**Per public reporting:**
- In 2013, Epstein emailed Colom: "On my island in the Caribbean, with an aquarium full of girls"
- Colom offered to introduce Epstein to ambassadors, European Parliament members, "a rising star of Indian politics," and "the Russian Deputy Minister of Economy"
- In September 2013, Colom brought French politician **Bruno Le Maire** (later Finance Minister) to Epstein's New York home
- Colom told Epstein "I want to make a lot of money" before one of Epstein's Paris trips
- Colom offered to provide Epstein "a good French butler"

### Significance
Colom served as Epstein's conduit into the heart of the Edmond de Rothschild banking operation and European political networks. His correspondence with Epstein used official EdR (France) email with full legal disclaimers, indicating the bank was aware (or should have been aware) of the relationship.

---

## 10. PROSECUTORIAL SIGNIFICANCE

### Potential Legal Questions

> **Note:** No criminal charges have been filed against any Rothschild entity or individual in connection with the matters described below. The following identifies statutes that investigators or prosecutors might examine based on the documented facts.

**1. Wire Fraud / Bank Fraud (18 U.S.C. sections 1343, 1344):**
The $25M consulting agreement for "risk analysis" and "algorithms" raises questions about the nature of the services provided: no evidence in the databases of any deliverable "risk analysis" or "algorithm" work product has been identified. The fee was contractually triggered by the DOJ settlement outcome, and Epstein had introduced Ruemmler — who negotiated that settlement — to the Rothschild bank. Whether this arrangement constitutes legitimate consulting or something else would be a question for investigators.

**2. Conspiracy to Obstruct Justice (18 U.S.C. section 1512):**
Creating an email channel described as one "that nobody can access" while a $25M payment and DOJ settlement were being negotiated raises questions about whether there was an intent to avoid oversight. No obstruction charges have been filed.

**3. Financial Layering (18 U.S.C. section 1956):**
The $25M flowed from Rothschild entities through Southern Trust into multiple hedge funds, trusts, and shell entities. This multi-step distribution is consistent with patterns that regulators examine for potential layering, though no money laundering charges have been filed in connection with these transactions.

**4. Tax Planning Questions:**
The November 2014 email exchange ([EFTA02362043](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02362043.pdf)) discussed Portugal residency programs and the PWC Luxembourg leak. Ariane characterized fiscal rulings as "legal, accepted procedures." The exchange shows awareness of cross-border tax planning, though the specific strategies discussed (Portugal residency) are legal in themselves.

**5. FARA Questions (22 U.S.C. section 611):**
Epstein acted as intermediary between Rothschild banking interests and Israeli defense/intelligence ventures (Carbyne/Reporty via Barak). Whether this activity would require FARA registration has not been formally examined.

### Key Questions for Further Investigation

1. **What did Ruemmler know and when?** She was simultaneously Epstein's close personal associate, the Rothschild bank's lawyer, and an officer of the court. Did she disclose Epstein's criminal history to the DOJ when negotiating the non-prosecution agreement?

2. **What services did Epstein actually provide for $25M?** No evidence in the databases of any deliverable "risk analysis" or "algorithm" work product.

3. **Was the $25M payment actually a fee for Epstein's introduction of Ruemmler?** The payment was contractually triggered by the DOJ settlement -- the very settlement Ruemmler negotiated.

4. **What communications exist on the aderfam.ch domain?** Swiss-hosted email outside the reach of standard US subpoenas.

5. **What was discussed at the "Appt w/Kathy & Ariane" meeting?** All three principals in the $25M/DOJ settlement in one room.

6. **Why did Benjamin de Rothschild wire $14,999,980 personally?** This was not from the bank -- it was personal funds, suggesting the relationship went beyond institutional consulting.

7. **What role did Deutsche Bank play in facilitating the relationship?** The extensive "Rothschild [C]" and "Being shown an offer!" email threads indicate the bank was aware of and actively managing the Rothschild-Epstein financial relationship.

## 11. DS9/DS11 EXPANDED FINDINGS (Full-Text Corpus Revisit)

### 11.1 Epstein as De Facto Chief Strategist

DS9 and DS11 reveal Epstein functioning as de facto chief strategist for the Edmond de Rothschild Group, far beyond the "risk analysis and algorithms" framing of the consulting agreement:

- **CEO Hiring** ([EFTA02341138](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02341138.pdf), April 2017): Epstein emailed Ariane a detailed corporate strategy memo advising on bringing in "boris plus 2 or 3" and targeting "jan 1" as a start date. "Boris" = Boris Collardi, former CEO of Julius Baer, who joined EdR in late 2017. DS9 confirms extensive direct Epstein-Collardi communication ([EFTA00450404](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00450404.pdf), [EFTA00636001](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00636001.pdf)). Collardi became CEO of EdR Group in 2019.
- **Compliance Restructuring** ([EFTA02337209](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02337209.pdf), April 2016): Ariane described a compliance crisis at EdR Luxembourg. Epstein advised: "the structure having compliance report to the ceo is one of the major issues. since he was dirty, core problem." He instructed Ariane to go "SLOW< all decision should be run by kathy" -- indicating Ruemmler was being consulted on bank governance decisions.
- **Merger Strategy** ([EFTA02341138](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02341138.pdf), April 2017): Epstein advised against a near-term merger ("I cant get a current merger to work") and instead proposed a "2020 transaction" timeline.
- **Family Estate Planning** ([EFTA02341138](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02341138.pdf)): Epstein instructed: "re-do family documents... wills, trusts."
- **Internal Politics** ([EFTA02341138](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02341138.pdf)): In a numbered strategic plan, Epstein wrote "castrate nadine" — crude language referring to marginalizing Nadine de Rothschild's (Benjamin's mother, Baroness) influence within the family governance structure. Ariane responded: "Could we please avoid these emails as all my assistants read them?"

### 11.2 Rothschild Family Financial Records in Epstein's Possession

- **[EFTA00593274](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00593274.pdf) (DS9):** Edmond de Rothschild (Suisse) SA Consolidated Cash Flow Statement at June 30, 2014 — the bank's internal consolidated financial statements (both consolidated and unconsolidated versions) were in Epstein's files. The consulting agreement covered "risk analysis," which could explain access to financial statements, though internal mid-year bank financials are not typically shared with external consultants.
- **[EFTA00611779](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00611779.pdf) (DS9):** A detailed Rothschild family personal cash flow spreadsheet covering 2015, with columns for homes (Pregny, Bretagne, Paris, Mozambique, Cameroon), foundations (agriculture, wine, vineyards, Lafite), investments, and an aviation budget totaling $4M (Gulfstream, Airbus, BBJ, helicopter). The granularity of this document — down to animal expenses, groceries, and helicopter hours — suggests a level of financial involvement beyond arms-length consulting.
- **[EFTA00310337](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00310337.pdf) (DS9):** Furniture invoice billed to "Baronne Benjamin de Rothschild c/o Marie Therese de Brignac, Chateau de Pregny" -- EUR 155,332.80 for Paola Lenti furniture, referencing "Mr. Epstein Jeff," confirming Epstein procured furnishings on the Rothschilds' behalf.
- **[EFTA00595998](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00595998.pdf) (DS9):** 40+ pages of auction invoices to "Baron/Baronne Benjamin de Rothschild" from Sotheby's, Christie's, Phillips, Piasa, Artcurial, Pierre Berge, and Tajan for Nov-Dec 2014 Paris auctions.

### 11.3 DNA Kits to Chateau de Pregny

**[EFTA00447582](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00447582.pdf) (DS9, March 17, 2017):** Epstein staff email: "we should have received 4 DNA Kits yesterday from Amazon (23 and Me kits) Jeffrey wants them Fed Ex'd to [redacted recipient] in Geneva... Chateau de Pregny: is the home address." The recipient name is redacted in the document; the Chateau de Pregny address is the Rothschild family residence. The purpose of the DNA kits is not stated in the document.

### 11.4 Noemie de Rothschild Direct Contact

**[EFTA00707542](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00707542.pdf) (DS9, May 5, 2015):** Noemie de Rothschild emailed Epstein directly: "Thought you would like it :) Noemie" -- the first document showing a Rothschild daughter communicating directly with Epstein. The original report mentioned Noemie only as discussed by Ariane.

### 11.5 July 2015 Multi-Day Meeting Schedule

Calendar entries [EFTA00304497](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00304497.pdf) / [EFTA00345338](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00345338.pdf) (DS9) show Epstein's schedule for July 19-21, 2015, including: "Kathy Ruemmler & Ariane de Rothschild along w/Setvine? Hamad? Cynthia? Henri? Summers? Shabaz?" The question marks after each name indicate a tentative guest list, not a confirmed roster. Other entries on the same schedule include meetings with Leon Black, Woody Allen, Brad Karp, and others. Possible identifications include Cynthia Tobiano (EdR executive) and Henri Ader (Ariane's lawyer), though these are inferences from first names only. This schedule was approximately 2 months before the consulting agreement was signed and 5 months before the DOJ settlement and $25M wire.
