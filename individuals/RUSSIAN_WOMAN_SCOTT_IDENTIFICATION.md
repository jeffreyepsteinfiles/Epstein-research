## PART A: The Russian/Eastern European Woman

### Key Biographical Details from [EFTA01792918](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01792918.pdf)

The email is a 5-page emotional communication from a young woman to Jeffrey Epstein. The extracted text reveals:

1. **Nationality/Origin**: Russian-speaking or Central Asian (from a former Soviet republic). Her email signature includes `foto.rambler.ru` (Russian internet service). She references going "home" where her parents live, mentions her dad, mom, brother, and boyfriend.

2. **University**: "Westminster International University in [REDACTED]" -- This is almost certainly **Westminster International University in Tashkent (WIUT)**, Uzbekistan. It is the ONLY institution in the world with this exact name. WIUT was established in 2002 as a franchise of the University of Westminster (London) and teaches entirely in English. This strongly suggests the woman is **Uzbek** (or from the broader Central Asian region), not Russian per se, though she uses Russian internet services (foto.rambler.ru, which is common across the former Soviet Union).

3. **Shoplifting Arrest**: She describes a shoplifting incident at Macy's with a friend. Both took clothes from the men's department to the women's fitting rooms. She was arrested and jailed, describing sitting "with 24 sick Afro-Americans till the evening of next day." Her lawyer said she could appear at her court date when she returns to the US.

4. **Failing Model Career**: "I hoped to have my job in the end of January as a model, very good, but they didn't like my hair."

5. **Visa Status**: Her visa expires on the 16th (February 16, 2011). She was considering staying in the US illegally but recognizes it is impossible.

6. **Financial Desperation**: She owes money to multiple people, has a credit at Chase bank from September, needs to pay for her studies, and is financially dependent on a female friend who "paid for me from January for everything."

7. **Work Prospect**: "I will have my work from March at Ages Engineering Company. They took me and I can feed myself."

8. **Sexual Transactional Dynamic**: She explicitly describes the dynamic with Epstein and his other women:
   - "Excuse me for being not happy as you used to see those babydolls"
   - "I know what you expect from me Jeffrey but I will not say that"
   - She describes other women saying "darling [I'm a] beautiful bitch who comes to your house and you like me... transfer me money sweetheart"
   - She describes men telling women "you babygirl are going to go with me at my place I will fuck you twice you will suck my cock and I will have your ass three times"
   - "I'm not a toy Jeffrey, thank you..."

9. **Flight**: She had a ticket for February 11th to go home.

10. **Epstein's Response (Feb 8)**: Epstein replied: "bring all the info.. your arrest and court date.. your visa info." -- This suggests Epstein was prepared to help with her legal situation, potentially using his lawyer network.

### Definitive Identification: Gul'sum Osmanova

**UPDATE (DS9/DS11 Revisit):** The full-text corpus definitively identifies the Feb 2011 email author as **Gul'sum Osmanova** (patronymic: Asanovna), an Uzbek woman from Tashkent/Samarkand. Her unredacted email address -- gulsum.osmanova@rambler.ru -- appears across 252 documents in DS9/DS10/DS11, including direct emails to Epstein (jeevacation@gmail.com), Skype chat extractions from Epstein's seized device, Western Union wire instructions to Richard Kahn, and bounced email delivery notifications.

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| **Full Name** | Gul'sum Osmanova |
| **Patronymic** | Asanovna |
| **Email** | gulsum.osmanova@rambler.ru |
| **Skype Handle** | bom_2_be_leader |
| **Nationality** | Uzbek |
| **Home Cities** | Tashkent (work) / Samarkand (family) |
| **Passport** | Uzbek, partial number visible ([EFTA00312812](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00312812.pdf)) |
| **Document Count** | 116 DS9 + 82 DS10 + 54 DS11 = **252 total** |

### Relationship Timeline (from Skype Logs and Emails)

**Jan-Feb 2011**: Osmanova in New York, visa expiring Feb 16. Epstein asks "do you have skype" and offers "i will give you money for taxi" ([EFTA00902359](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00902359.pdf)). The 5-page emotional email at [EFTA01792918](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01792918.pdf) is from this period.

**Feb 7, 2011**: Osmanova replies to Epstein's "i leave tonight, would you like to come see me to say goodbye" with a maps.rambler.ru link containing Cyrillic text ([EFTA00671123](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00671123.pdf)).

**Feb-Jun 2011**: Extended Skype exchanges captured in device extraction. Epstein displays controlling behavior: "i am waiting your explanation" (Jun 10), "still waiting" (Jun 13), "well?" (Jun 13) ([EFTA00517137](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00517137.pdf)).

**Jun 19, 2011**: Epstein via Skype: "have you gotten your visa? I am expecting you" ([EFTA00517137](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00517137.pdf) p.10).

**Jun 30, 2011**: Osmanova from Tashkent describes difficult family situation: weight of 45 kg, parents "screaming and beating," got passport back ([EFTA00518012](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00518012.pdf) p.2-3).

**Jul 5, 2011**: Epstein Skype lists ESL schools ("spanish american institute,,, american language center,,, new york general consulting school ESL") followed immediately by "suck cock" ([EFTA00518012](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00518012.pdf) p.10). This juxtaposition of education assistance and sexual demand captures the coercive dynamic.

**Jul 11, 2011**: Epstein: "paris visa please... us school application soon" -- directing her immigration and education ([EFTA00518012](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00518012.pdf) p.16).

**Aug 2012-Sep 2012**: Osmanova in Malaysia/Tashkent. Requests dental treatment costs. Richard Kahn wired $4,800 via Western Union to Tashkent with her full passport number ([EFTA00312812](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00312812.pdf)).

**Sep 2014-Mar 2015**: AmEx Centurion Travel booked multiple flights to/from Tashkent -- St Petersburg to Tashkent (Aeroflot), Moscow to Paris to Tashkent routes, Turkish Airlines Istanbul to Tashkent ([EFTA00288050](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00288050.pdf), [EFTA00291471](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00291471.pdf), [EFTA00308149](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00308149.pdf)).

**Nov 19, 2014**: Flying to meet Epstein, asks "Whom should I write my flight details to?" ([EFTA00358517](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00358517.pdf)).

### Assessment

Osmanova fits the documented profile of Epstein's exploitation: a young woman from a difficult family situation in a developing country, with visa/immigration vulnerability, financial dependence, and a sexual-transactional dynamic. Epstein simultaneously controlled her education prospects (ESL schools, visa applications), provided financial support through his accountant Richard Kahn, and demanded sexual compliance -- all captured in the Skype chat logs extracted from his seized devices (case reference NYC024329.aff4).

### Correction: "Nina K." is a Separate Individual

The original report hypothesized that "Nina K." might be the same person as the Feb 2011 email author. This is **definitively disproven** by the full-text corpus. "Nina K." is **Nina Keita** (email: ninakeita@hotmail.com), a completely separate individual -- a West African diplomatic intermediary, not an Uzbek student. See Section E below for full Nina Keita identification.

The DS10 documents previously attributed to a possible match ([EFTA01774144](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01774144.pdf), [EFTA01773765](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01773765.pdf), etc.) are confirmed as Nina Keita's correspondence, not Osmanova's. The "Hello Jeffrey!" greeting and UN ambassador references belong to Keita's diplomatic intermediary role, not to Osmanova's personal relationship with Epstein.

### Separate Russian Woman ([EFTA02474955](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02474955.pdf) -- January 2016)

A **different** Russian woman communicated with Epstein via email.ru (Russian email service) in January 2016. Key details:
- Her US visa expired; tourist visa canceled in May 2013 at the airport
- She applied for a K1 (fiance) visa but received the passport back with an error
- Her birthday was December 7
- She mentions the falling Russian ruble
- Epstein asks for "a photo of the visa" and "a naughty selfie please ::))"
- Uses Russian-language email headers ("Bockpecenbe" = Sunday in Russian)
- This appears to be a **separate individual** from the Feb 2011 email author

### Uzbekistan Connection ([EFTA02439412](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02439412.pdf)/[EFTA02439446](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02439446.pdf) -- July 2009)

An email from July 2, 2009 mentions: "She is busy this weekend with a friend from Uzbekistan." This is an associate/employee of Epstein describing a woman who has an Uzbek friend. While this predates the Feb 2011 email by 19 months, it establishes that Uzbek connections existed in Epstein's circle.

### Conclusion on the Feb 2011 Email Author

The woman in [EFTA01792918](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01792918.pdf) is **definitively identified** as **Gul'sum Osmanova**, an Uzbek national from Tashkent/Samarkand. The original report's hypothesis that she might be "Nina K." is disproven; Nina K. is a separate individual named Nina Keita (see Section E). Osmanova's identity is confirmed by her unredacted email address (gulsum.osmanova@rambler.ru) appearing across 252 documents, corroborated by Skype chat logs from Epstein's seized device, Western Union wire records, and AmEx travel bookings to Tashkent.

## PART B: "Scott" Who Was Flying Friends to the Island

### The Email Content ([EFTA01793116](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01793116.pdf))

The message states: "Scott is wondering if he will be in st Thomas at least till Tuesday as he is having his friend fly to [REDACTED] to keep him company at night."

**Key contextual clues:**
- Date: Feb 12, 2011, 9:14 PM (Saturday evening)
- The sender is a third party relaying Scott's question to Epstein
- "Scott" has the means to have a friend "fly" to the island
- He wants female "company at night" -- strongly implying the procurement of women
- He is staying in or near St. Thomas (near Epstein's Little St. James island)
- He wants to know Epstein's schedule (whether Epstein will be there "at least till Tuesday")
- PLIST remote-id: 134807 (sequential with the preceding email at 134806 from someone discussing "Kleinwort CEO" and flying to Dallas)

### All "Scotts" Found in the Epstein Files

| Name | Role | Island Connection | Likelihood |
|------|------|-------------------|------------|
| **Scott Denett** | IT/technology specialist for Epstein; managed internet/networking in Epstein's NYC apartments; tracked by time by Richard Barnett; worked at 71st St, 301 E 66th, and other properties; confirmed coming "to see Jeff"; paired with pilot Larry Visoski in one email | No evidence of island visits; was a supervised hourly worker | **LOW** -- too operational/subordinate to be "having friends fly to the island" |
| **Scott Stambaugh** | Aircraft mechanic/maintenance for Epstein's B727; on email chain with Larry Visoski, Peter Swift, Larry Morrison, Daniel Herring, Marion Wiley about B727 fuel tank repairs | Connected to aircraft maintenance but not as a guest | **LOW** -- a mechanic, not a guest who would arrange female company |
| **Scott Borgerson** | Ghislaine Maxwell's boyfriend (2018-2020); maritime shipping CEO; married Maxwell secretly; DOB, SSN, and bank accounts documented in multiple FBI investigation files | Was in Manchester by the Sea, MA; no 2011 connection | **VERY LOW** -- not known to be in Epstein's orbit until ~2013-2015 at earliest |
| **Scott Rothstein** | Florida attorney/Ponzi schemer; was co-defendant with Epstein in civil lawsuit (Epstein v. Rothstein) | Based in Fort Lauderdale, FL; was arrested/convicted in 2009 for a $1.2B Ponzi scheme; **was in federal prison by January 2010** | **IMPOSSIBLE** -- was incarcerated by Feb 2011 |
| **Scott Stackman** | UBS Financial Advisor (with Lyle Casriel) for Ghislaine Maxwell's accounts | No island connection; NYC-based financial advisor | **VERY LOW** -- professional banking relationship only |
| **Scott Kornspan** | Attorney at Black Srebnick Kornspan & Stumpf, P.A.; represented Epstein in Florida legal matters | Legal counsel, not a social associate | **VERY LOW** |
| **Scott Graf/Graff** | Referenced in Firstbank PR (Puerto Rico) wire transfer; also subject of emails from Jeanne Brennan/Daphne Wallace (Epstein's staff) | Puerto Rico financial connection | **MODERATE** -- insufficient data to evaluate |
| **"Scott"** (unidentified) | Subject of [EFTA01975323](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01975323.pdf): "outstanding invoice payment" | Unknown | **UNKNOWN** |
| **Scott Lindell** | Appears in what seems to be a contact/address list alongside Adam Lindemann | Unknown | **LOW** |

### Analysis of the "Scott" Email

**UPDATE (DS9/DS11 Revisit):** DS9 and DS11 contain additional copies of this email that resolve the sender identity and the woman's name.

**[EFTA00560939](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00560939.pdf)** (DS9 copy): "From: **Sarah K** / To: Jeffrey Epstein / Scott is wondering if he will be in st Thomas at least till Tuesday as he is having his friend, [partially visible],(the girl who came to see him in PB last time) fly to st Thomas tomorrow to keep him company at night"

**[EFTA02321273](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02321273.pdf)** (DS11 copy): Names the woman as **Morgan** -- "the girl who came to see him in PB last time."

**[EFTA02535560](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02535560.pdf)** (DS11 copy): From: **Sarah** -- same content, confirming "Morgan" as the woman's name.

**Resolved findings:**

1. **Sender: Sarah Kellen** -- NPA-protected co-conspirator and Epstein's primary scheduler/procurement coordinator. The email was sent by Kellen ("Sarah K" / "Sarah"), meaning the "Scott" request went through Epstein's trafficking infrastructure.

2. **Woman: "Morgan"** -- First name only. "The girl who came to see him in PB last time" establishes that she had previously visited "Scott" at Palm Beach, indicating a repeat pattern.

3. **Procurement pattern**: Sarah Kellen relaying a guest's request for a woman to be "flown in" to "keep him company at night" is consistent with the documented procurement role Kellen played in Epstein's operation.

4. **Epstein's location**: Scott is asking about Epstein's schedule in St. Thomas, suggesting Scott would be there as Epstein's guest or neighbor on the island.

5. **February 2011 timing**: This is during Epstein's post-conviction period (released from Florida custody in 2009, still on sex offender probation). Epstein was using his private island extensively during this period.

### "Scott" Identity -- Still Unresolved But Narrowed

While the sender and the woman have been identified, "Scott" himself remains unidentified by surname. DS9 contains references to several Scotts in Epstein's operational orbit, all of which can be excluded or deprioritized:
- **Scott Denett**: IT specialist at 71st St/HBRK, hourly worker -- too subordinate (confirmed by [EFTA00429579](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00429579.pdf), [EFTA00435341](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00435341.pdf))
- **Scott Peterson**: Marine equipment/boat dealer, cc'd on Bahamas boat demo emails with Visoski -- a vendor, not a guest ([EFTA00370347](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00370347.pdf))
- **Scott Borgerson**: Maxwell's boyfriend -- not in orbit until ~2013+
- **Scott Rothstein**: In federal prison by January 2010

The "Scott" who had Sarah Kellen relay his message to Epstein was familiar enough to be on first-name basis with both Kellen and Epstein, and had a repeat pattern of receiving women at Palm Beach. His identity requires cross-referencing flight records, island visitor logs, or Palm Beach visitor records from the Feb 2011 period.

---

## PART C: Contextual Email Traffic -- Night of February 12, 2011

The following emails were received by Epstein's jeevacation@gmail.com account on the same evening, providing context for who was communicating with him:

| Time | EFTA | remote-id | Content |
|------|------|-----------|---------|
| 9:06 PM | [EFTA01793179](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01793179.pdf) | 134806 | [REDACTED sender] "Flying to Dallas tomorrow morning. Should I write to Jes for meeting Thu/Fri in NYC? Had lunch with Kleinwort CEO - he wants me to make proposal." |
| 9:13 PM | [EFTA02038751](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA02038751.pdf) | N/A | [REDACTED sender] Email to jeevacation@gmail.com -- content fully redacted/blank |
| 9:14 PM | [EFTA01793116](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01793116.pdf) | 134807 | [REDACTED sender] "Scott is wondering if he will be in st Thomas at least till Tuesday..." |
| 10:23 PM | [EFTA01792918](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01792918.pdf) | 134811 | [REDACTED sender] The Russian/Uzbek woman's 5-page emotional email |

The sequential remote-ids (134806, 134807) suggest the Kleinwort CEO email and the Scott email arrived nearly consecutively in Epstein's Gmail inbox.

---

## PART D: Nina Keita Documents (Previously Attributed to "Nina K.")

**UPDATE (DS9/DS11 Revisit):** The DS10 documents previously listed under "Nina K." are now confirmed as belonging to **Nina Keita** (ninakeita@hotmail.com), a West African diplomatic intermediary -- a completely separate individual from Gul'sum Osmanova. See Section E below for the full Nina Keita identification.

### [EFTA02672121](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02672121.pdf) -- "Nina's iPhone" (November 17, 2013)
- **Now identified as**: Nina Keita
- **Content**: "Hello Jeffrey, contacted the lawyer and he is working on my permit. I'll be there from the 28th to Dec 2nd (the day he's allowed visits). Thank you very much for your help! Also I wanted to know if you had any news (negative or positive) from bath and body works?"
- **Significance**: "The day he's allowed visits" refers to Epstein's probation/registration period. The "permit" reference pertains to Keita's visit arrangements, not Osmanova's immigration situation.

### [EFTA02469744](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02469744.pdf) -- Epstein to "Nina K" (February 21, 2016)
- **Now identified as**: correspondence with Nina Keita
- Jeffrey E. (jeevacation@gmail.com) emailing Nina Keita directly
- Keita's appointments with Epstein span at least October 2011 through April 2016

### [EFTA02474955](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02474955.pdf) -- Russian Woman with Expired Visa (January 2016)
- A separate Russian woman (uses mail.ru email service) communicating with Epstein
- Her US tourist visa was canceled in May 2013 at the airport
- Applied for K1 (fiance) visa through a friend
- Birthday: December 7
- Discussed falling Russian ruble
- Epstein asks for visa photos and "naughty selfie"
- **This is a third, distinct individual** -- neither Osmanova nor Keita

---

## PART E: Nina Keita -- West African Diplomatic Intermediary

**UPDATE (DS9/DS11 Revisit):** DS9 reveals Nina Keita's identity and her function in Epstein's network as the primary conduit to Ivory Coast's political elite and UN diplomatic presence. She is confirmed as a separate individual from Gul'sum Osmanova.

| | Gul'sum Osmanova | Nina Keita |
|---|---|---|
| Email | gulsum.osmanova@rambler.ru | ninakeita@hotmail.com |
| Nationality | Uzbek | West African (Ivorian/Guinean connection) |
| Role | Financial/sexual dependent | Diplomatic intermediary |
| Family | Parents in Samarkand | Connected to Ouattara political dynasty |
| Device | Skype (bom_2_be_leader) | iPhone, then BlackBerry |
| Doc Count | 252 | 498 (240 DS9 + 167 DS10 + 91 DS11) |

### Nina Keita's Role: West African Diplomatic Access Broker

**Oct 20-21, 2011** ([EFTA00921801](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00921801.pdf)): Nina arranges meeting with Mr. Bamba Joseph, Ivorian Ambassador at the UN. She references the "inauguration" -- coinciding with Alassane Ouattara's inauguration as President of Ivory Coast (May 2011).

**Oct 23, 2011** ([EFTA00425678](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00425678.pdf)): Meeting confirmed at 9 East 71st Street: "Appt w/Nina Keita and Mr. Bamba Joseph, Ivorian Ambassador at the UN."

**Jan 7, 2012** ([EFTA00672410](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00672410.pdf), [EFTA00877574](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00877574.pdf)): Nina arranges Epstein's trip to Abidjan, Ivory Coast: "I also have to introduce you to the ivorian ambassador in paris for a visa." She recommends the Sofitel Pullman hotel, noting "The minister of mines lives ther[e]." Epstein responds: "I will fly private instead, my tail number is 909 JE" -- confirming Epstein traveled to Ivory Coast on his private aircraft.

**Jun 16-18, 2012** ([EFTA00411246](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00411246.pdf)): Nina brings her cousin **Dramane Ouattara and his wife Louise Ouattara** to meet Epstein at 9 East 71st Street. Email sent from ninakeita@hotmail.com to lesley.jee@gmail.com.

**Sep 12, 2013** ([EFTA00383978](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00383978.pdf)): Epstein to Nina regarding her uncle: "you can also tell your uncle that bill gates, ehud barak, who he recently met with and thorbjorn jagland, sec general counsel of the council of europe will be at the house. if we would like to join he is welcome."

### The Ouattara Connection

The Ouattara surname is that of Alassane Dramane Ouattara, President of Ivory Coast since 2010. "Dramane Ouattara" (Nina's cousin) shares the President's own second given name, suggesting close family. Combined with Nina's access to the Ivorian Ambassador, the "minister of mines," and the reference to "the inauguration," this establishes that Epstein was cultivating direct access to the ruling political family of a West African nation. This parallels the documented Mandelson-Congo-Ollivier connection and Epstein's pattern of pursuing relationships with foreign heads of state and their inner circles.

## PART F: Epstein Device Extraction -- Skype Logs

[EFTA00515496](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00515496.pdf), [EFTA00517137](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00517137.pdf), and [EFTA00518012](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00518012.pdf) (all DS9) are Cellebrite device extractions from Epstein's seized phone/computer (case data reference NYC024329.aff4). These contain Skype chat histories revealing:
- Conversations with **Gul'sum Osmanova** (bom_2_be_leader)
- Conversations with **Lawrence Krauss** (interspersed with Osmanova chats)
- Conversations with **Dasha Grupman** (dasha.grupman)
- Conversations with **Francis Jardine Deuss** (francisjardinedeuss)
- Conversations with **Lana Zakocela** (lanazakocela)
- Conversations with **"Catherine"** (handle redacted)

The Skype logs capture Epstein's controlling behavior in real time -- repeated demands for responses ("still waiting," "well?," "i am waiting your explanation"), mixed with sexual demands and financial control.

## PART G: Incidental Findings
