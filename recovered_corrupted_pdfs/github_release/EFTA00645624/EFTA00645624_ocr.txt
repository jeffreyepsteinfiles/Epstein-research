RE: Jeffrey Epstein vs. Scott Rothstein, Bradley J. Edwards, et al

15th Judicial Circuit Case No. 502009CA040800XXXXMB

UMC Hearing - Wednesday - 4/22/15 at 8:45

Jeffrey Epstein's 3/24/15 Motion to Place 6/2/14 Motion For

Fees/Costs - on Non-JuryDocket

This morning I attended the hearing on our Motion to be placed on the Non-Jury Docket. Judge
Hafele was not in a particularly good mood.
I spoke with Jack Scarola last night and he agreed that the issue should be placed on the Non-
Jury Docket, but suggested that we request a Status Conference with the Court to establish
Discovery and Disclosure Schedules. I agreed that this was a good idea and, therefore, I
requested same of Judge Hafele. Judge Hafele was not keen on having any more extended
hearings on this issue and made the statement that he "did not think that it would take that much
time and effort to determine reasonable fees." He, therefore, instructed the parties to develop
their own Schedule within (15) days and that if there was a dispute - file a Motion and set it for
hearing.
He set Calendar Call for Friday - July 24, 2015 at 9:00 a.m..
He set us on the August 3 - October 9, 2015 Non-Jury Docket.
On his own volition, he ordered us to Mediation, with said Mediation to take place at least (10)
days prior to the beginning of the Docket.
At the conclusion of the hearing, the Judge stated that he "wanted this case over with."
I will contact Scarola to discuss Disclosure dates and cutoffs for Discovery and, of course, I
would love to have suggestions from our team.
A copy of the Court's Order is attached.
