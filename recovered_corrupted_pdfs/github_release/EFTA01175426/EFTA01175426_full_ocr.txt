Code section 17005(a)(2) because San Mateo County is the principal place of the Trust’s

-administration.

2. Notice: The Court finds that Notice has been given in the manner prescribed

-by law:

3. Allegations are True and Correct. All allegations in the Petition are true

and correct.

4. Specific Finding re Trustees’ Intent with Respect to Distributions. The

Court specifically finds as follows with respect to the Trustees’ intent to determine the
amount of the income beneficiary’s distributions:

Because the Trust is an ideal candidate for adjusting principal and income, the
Trustees intend to determine the amount of annual distributions to ELISA using the

following procedure:

a. Each year, Petitioners and the institutional Trustee (e.g., J.P.

MORGAN TRUST COMPANY, NA) shall determine the amount of “aggregate income

of the Trusts” available to fund discretionary distributions to ELISA from either the GST
Exempt Trust or the GST Non-Exempt Trust. They intend to do so by multiplying the
mean average of the fair market value of aggregate assets of the Trusts (as determined in
accordance with general standards used for gift and estate tax valuation purposes without
regard for any possible discounts that may be allowed for fractional interests or lack of
marketability) as of December 31 for each of the three preceding calendar years by the
percentage of annual asset value that J.P, MORGAN CHASE BANK (the corporate parent
of J.P. MORGAN TRUST COMPANY, NA), or other institutional Trustee then serving,
determines that it should use under principal and income adjustment powers available when
acting as trustee of taxable trusts subject to the Uniform Principal and Income Act or

comparable statues (the “Adjustment Percentage”). P]

Pl For example, to determine the Adjusted Distribution Ceiling for distributions to be made
to ELISA in calendar year 2009, before March 1, 2009 the Trustees will determine the

mean average of the fair market value of the combined Trust estate as of December 31,

The resulting product (which may be pure income only, or may be income
augmented by principal which is “adjusted” into income), which may also be referred to as
the “Adjusted Distribution Ceiling,” shall be the maximum amount of funds the Trustees
may distribute to ELISA that calendar year from both Trusts. The parties have agreed that
in no event shall the Adjusted Distribution Ceiling drop below 3.0 percent. The product
shall be pro-rated for the initial year of this procedure. For the information of the Court,
J.P. MORGAN CHASE BANK set the Adjustment Percentage at 3.0% for 2008, with no
trustee’s fees being charged against that 3.0% payout. In other words, for taxable trusts
invested under the Prudent Investor Rule and CUPIA for total maximum return, in selected
circumstances J.P. MORGAN CHASE BANK as trustee adjusted principal and income so
that “income” beneficiaries would receive 3.0% of the ageregate fair market value of the
GST Exempt Trust and the GST Non-Exempt Trust; and in those situations, J.P. MORGAN
CHASE BANK charged trustee’s fees entirely to principal, so the 3% payout to the

It is anticipated that the funding of discretionary distributions of aggregate net
income of the ‘Trusts pursuant to the standard set forth above will be made first from the
GST Non-Exempt Trust to the extent practical and then from the GST Exempt Trust. In no
event will aggregate discretionary distributions from the Trusts excéed the Adjusted
Distribution Ceiling.

J.P. MORGAN CHASE BANK determines the Adj ustmeént Percentage early each
calendar year for which an adjustment is to be made. The Trustees therefore intend to give
notice to the trust beneficiaries of the amount of the Adjusted Distribution Ceiling by
March 1 of each calendar year for which an income and principal adjustment is to be made,
under the procedure described for giving Notice of Proposed Action under California - ,

...continued)
¢ 2006, 2007 and 2008. They will then multiply that average dollar value by the percentage
of annual asset value that J.P. MORGAN CHASE BANK (or other institutional Trustee
then serving) determines that it should use for calendar year 2009 under principal and
income adjustment powers available when acting as trustee of taxable trusts subject to the
Uniform Principal and Income Act or comparable statutes. .

Probate Code Section. 16337. Until the time for objecting to such Notice has lapsed, the
Trustees will use the Adjusted Distribution Ceiling from the prior calendar year, and
subsequently credit (or charge) the beneficiary for any underpayments (or overpayments)
made that year before the new Adjusted Distribution Ceiling is determined.

b. Prior to January ist of each year, ELISA’s conservator will submit to
the Co-Trustees an annual estimate of her anticipated general maintenance, support, health ,
and educational needs, detailed on a monthly basis. If no conservator is then serving, the
estimate will be submitted by ELISA. ,

The Trustees will review ELISA’s budget to determine the amount of cash
necessary or advisable for her general maintenance, support, health or education, including
college, graduate and professional education, taking into consideration the factors described
in Article SECOND as modified by this Court and also retaining an appropriate reserve for
extraordinary medical or other unanticipated expenses falling within the standard for
distributions set forth above. The Trustees shall then distribute to ELISA’s conservator or
expend directly. for het benefit the amount so determined in monthly or other convenient
installments from the GST Non-Exempt Tnist and then the GST Exempt Trust as described
above. If such distributions are less than net accounting income, the Trustees shall add the
excess to principal of the Trust’no less than annually. Ifthe amount determined to be
necessary or advisable for the maintenarice, support, health or education of ELISA and her
unanticipated-expenses exceeds the Adjusted Distribution Ceiling established by the
Trustees for that calendar year, then the Trustees shall distribute no more than the Adjusted

Distribution Ceiling, with ELISA making up any shortfall from her personal assets.

“gwing to circumstances not known to the settlor and not anticipated by the settlor, the
continuation of the trust under its terms would defeat or substantially impair the
accomplishment of the purposes of the trust.” The enormous increase in the value of the
Trust since its inception, coupled with intervening changes in the tax and trust law, justify
modifying the terms of the Trust without jeopardizing the Trust’s ability to accomplish its
primary goal of providing significant benefits for the lifetime of ELISA ZAFFARONL For
good cause appearing for the reasons set forth in the verified petition of the Trustees, the

Irrevocable Trust Agreement dated April 15, 1989 for the benefit of ELISA ZAFFARONI

is hereby modified as follows:

Division into GST Exempt and GST Non-Exempt Trusts. The

a

Trustees shall divide the Trust into a GST Exempt Trust and a GST Non-Exempt Trust in
accordance with the applicable fraction (as defined in IRC Section 2642(a)(2)) of the
original trust as it is finally determined. Fach such resulting trust will have terms identical

to.the original Trust, as modified pursuant to the terms of this Order.

b. Modification of Distribution Standard During ELISA
ZAFFAROND's Lifetime. Article SECOND is hereby modified as follows:

“During the lifetime of ELISA ZAFFARONI, the Trustees shall pay to
or apply for the benefit of ELISA ZAFFARONI and any of her issue
(as defined in the following paragraph) so much of the “aggregate
income of the Trusts” as the Trustees shall determine necessary or
advisable for the maintenance, support, health or education, including
college, graduate and professional education, of ELISA ZAFFARONI
and any of her issue (as defined in the followitig paragraph), provided
that no payments shall be made so as to relieve anyone of the legal
obligation to support a beneficiary of either the GST Exempt Trust or
the GST Non-Exempt Trust. “Aggregate income of the Trusts” as
used in the preceding sentence shall mean combined trust income of
the GST Non-Exempt Trust and the GST Exempt Trust determined on
an aggregate basis by the corporate Trustee after applying the CUPIA
adjustment powers under Probate Code Sections 16335-16339. The
determination as to the necessity and amount of any payment under the
foregoing standard, and the GST Exempt or GST Non-Exempt-source
of such payment shall be made in the sole and absolute discretion of
the Trustees and in light of the needs and best interests of the
-beneficiaries and all of the circumstances existing at the time of the
determination, including the size and composition of the assets of each
