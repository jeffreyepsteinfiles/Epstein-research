Case No. 9:08-cv-80736-Marra/Johnson

JANE DOE #1 and JANE DOE #2
v.
UNITED STATES
__________________________/

UNOPPOSED MOTION OF JANE DOE 1 AND 2 TO EXCEED PAGE LIMITS IN THEIR
RESPONSE TO THE GOVERNMENT'S MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT

COME NOW Jane Doe 1 and Jane Doe 2 (hereinafter "the victims"), by and through
undersigned counsel, to file this unopposed motion for leave to file a 64-page
response to the Government's motion for summary judgment.

As the Court is aware, this is a complex, long-running case, involving important
and precedent setting issues concerning the Crime Victims' Rights Act. Because of
the complexity of the case, the Court granted the victims leave to file a single,
sixty-page motion for summary judgment, which included 157 separate assertions of
material fact. DE 361 at 8-47. In response, the Government has filed three separate
documents: First, the Government has filed a twenty-page Response to Petitioners'
Statement of Undisputed Material Facts in Support of Petitioners' Motion for Partial
Summary Judgment, DE 407; second, the Government has filed its own 8-page Statement
of Undisputed Material Facts in Support of Cross-Motion for Summary Judgment, DE 402;
and third, the Government filed a 30-page Response and Opposition to Petitioners'
Motion for Partial Summary Judgment and Cross-Motion for Summary Judgment.
