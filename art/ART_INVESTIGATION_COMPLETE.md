# PART I: THE MONEY

## 1. $30.5 Million in Auction Proceeds (2017)

**Primary Source: [EFTA00027019](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00027019.pdf)** (Exhibit D: Transactions Involving the Haze Trust Accounts)

The single most significant art financial document in the corpus. It shows massive auction proceeds flowing into Epstein-controlled accounts in a single calendar year:

| Date | Payer | Recipient | Amount |
|------|-------|-----------|--------|
| 6/19/2017 | **Christie's Inc** | The Haze Trust Checking | **$7,725,000** |
| 9/25/2017 | **Sotheby's** | The Haze Trust Checking | **$11,536,544** |
| 10/24/2017 | **Sotheby's** | The Haze Trust Checking | **$11,249,417** |
| | | **TOTAL** | **$30,510,961** |

The Haze Trust subsequently moved these funds through a network of accounts:
- 3/10/2017: $36M from Haze Trust Brokerage to Checking, then $35.999M to DBAGNY
- 3/27/2017: $15M from Haze Trust DBAGNY to **Plan D, LLC Checking**
- 9/26/2017: $15M from Haze Trust Checking to DBAGNY
- 10/26/2017: $13M from Haze Trust Checking to DBAGNY
- Subsequent large transfers to **Southern Financial LLC** totaling tens of millions (2018-2019)

**What sold:** The specific artworks generating these proceeds have not been identified in the document corpus. Given the dollar amounts ($7.7M at Christie's, two payments of $11.2M and $11.5M at Sotheby's), these were major auction consignments — likely Old Masters, Impressionists, or Modern works.

## 2. Leon Black's $2.7 Billion Art Collection

This is the single most significant art-world connection to Epstein. The DOJ files reveal Epstein was the central figure managing Leon Black's art investment machine from 2012-2017.

### The Apollo Conflicts Committee / Dechert LLP Report

**[EFTA02730996](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2012/EFTA02730996.pdf)** — The report states Epstein advised Black on "myriad esoteric issues" including:

> **(i) managing Black's artwork, (ii) advising on issues relating to Black's yacht, and (iii) advising on issues relating to Black's airplane**

Section titled "Managing Black's Artwork":

> "Family Office witnesses generally agreed that Epstein advised Black in a few areas related to Black's artwork, including: **(i) the formation of a new art partnership, (ii) the contested ownership of a Picasso sculpture, (iii) Black's art loans, (iv) like-kind exchanges, and (v) obtaining a potential advisory opinion from the New York State Department of Taxation and Finance** regarding a contemplated transaction involving Black's art."

> "Although Family Office employees generally agreed that Epstein was not an expert in art management or art law, witnesses also opined that he was helpful in the formation of the art partnership and was **fairly involved in assisting Black in connection with the sale of certain pieces of artwork**."

### Senate Finance Committee (Sen. Ron Wyden) — Interrogatories

**[EFTA02731023](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2012/EFTA02731023.pdf)** — Senator Wyden's letters to Leon Black include:

> "In a briefing with the Committee on August 1, 2022, your outside counsel indicated that **Epstein provided substantial advice related to your private art collection, which is worth over $1 billion**. This advice reportedly included helping you form a new art partnership as well as assistance in connection with the sale of certain pieces of artwork."

Sub-questions demanded:
- (a) Purpose of the new art partnership and Epstein's role
- (b) Details on **art loans** involving Epstein
- (c) List of **like-kind exchange transactions** for pieces valued over $1 million, with tax benefits obtained
- (d) List of **art sales valued at over $1 million** Epstein assisted with

From the same document:
> "Committee staff submitted a second set of questions regarding Epstein's compensation scheme. These questions also inquired about **advice Epstein provided in relation to your private art collection, which your outside counsel confirmed in a briefing has a value of more than $1 billion**. Again, you refused to provide answers to those questions."

### Key Facts
- **Collection size**: 935 artworks valued at $2.7 billion (2016 Christie's appraisal)
- **Payments**: Black paid Epstein $158 million for "tax and estate planning services" between 2012-2017
- **Senate investigation**: Evidence indicates actual payments were "significantly higher than previously known" and money "was used to finance Epstein's sex trafficking operations"
- **Settlement**: Leon Black agreed to pay $62.5 million to settle USVI Epstein-related claims

### Leon Black Art Gallery for a Woman

**[EFTA02731697](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2012/EFTA02731697.pdf)** — Email from Jeanne M. Christensen (Partner, Wigdor LLP) dated June 7, 2021:

> "I made some progress on one of the women that allegedly had a relationship with Leon Black for whom **he helped start an art gallery** (at least he told my client that he had done so)"

Entity details: 237 Lafayette Street #6E, New York, NY 10012. DOMESTIC LIMITED LIABILITY COMPANY. Status: **INACTIVE — Dissolution (Sep 06, 2018)**.

## 7. Art Insurance

### Art Insurance Policy

**[EFTA01896117](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01896117.pdf) / [EFTA01896135](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01896135.pdf) / [EFTA01896183](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01896183.pdf) / [EFTA01896243](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01896243.pdf)** (four variants of same email chain):

> "It's included in the art insurance payment. There is no separate bill for the **bronzes**."
> "Just tons and tons of bills."

This confirms Epstein maintained a dedicated **art insurance policy** covering paintings and bronze sculptures. The bronzes were bundled into a larger art insurance payment, indicating a substantial collection.

### Epstein Insurance Trust

Stewart Oldfield and Daphne Cales managed this trust, which likely held insurance policies covering Epstein's art and other assets.

## 8. Estate Valuation

### Petition for Probate and Letters Testamentary

**[EFTA00027979](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00027979.pdf)** — The estate filing lists personal property totaling **$577,672,654.00**:

| Category | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Cash | $56,547,773 |
| Fixed Income Investments | $14,304,679 |
| Equities | $112,679,138 |
| Aviation, Automobiles, Boats | $18,551,700 |
| **Fine Arts, Antiques, Collectibles** | **TBD subject to appraisal/valuation** |
| Hedge Funds & Private Equity | $194,986,301 |

The "Fine Arts, Antiques, Collectibles" line was **never publicly valued**.

### GVI First Amended Complaint

**[EFTA00018778](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00018778.pdf)**: "The Estate has **not yet valued his fine arts, antiques, and other valuables**."

Given $30.5M in 2017 auction proceeds alone, the collection was likely worth tens of millions at minimum.

Response provides Christie's NY contacts and procedure: "The best way to start is to send pictures of the items you want to sell. From there, they will pass the items on to the various appraisal departments."

**Junkermann:** "Interesting situation around this company [Auctionata/Paddles] would you like to hear more or not interested?"

**Epstein:** "always interested in anything you are"

Auctionata was a Berlin-based online auction platform merged with Paddle8 (NY) in October 2016. The combined entity collapsed in early 2017 amid sham bidding allegations. Epstein had previously brokered a Junkermann-Leon Black introduction ([EFTA02435071](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02435071.pdf)).

> `Gregory Hedberg / DEGAS' / LITTLE / DANCER, / AGED / FOURTEEN / the earlier version that helped spark the birth of Modern Art`

This is a reference to the book by Gregory Hedberg about the discovery of an earlier version of Degas' famous sculpture "La Petite Danseuse de Quatorze Ans."

The correspondent asks about size and offers advice on photographing. The email footer references Christie's website and **LotFinder(R)** (Christie's search engine) and **Christie's Live(TM)** internet bidding. Subject line: "Vic Munoz."

"Vic Munoz" likely refers to **Vik Muniz**, a Brazilian artist known for recreating famous artworks in unconventional materials including chocolate. This may be a Vik Muniz chocolate-based recreation of a Pollock, not an actual Pollock.

# PART V: THE PEOPLE

## 41. Rowlands

**[EFTA00024431](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00024431.pdf)** — Letter from David Rowlands (August 26, 2019):

> "My late father **John Kendall Rowlands was an art historian and art collector**. He assisted Jeffrey Epstein in **sourcing and disposing of works of art** and may very well have **loaned items to him** as well. I understand that Jeffrey Epstein **owed him a substantial sum of money in consultation fees** in relation to works of art."

> "My father did mention in passing **the presence of young girls** with Jeffrey Epstein and had he not sadly died I expect my father would have reported his concerns to the relevant authorities."

This establishes that Epstein employed professional art historians to source and dispose of art, owed substantial fees, and that an art consultant personally witnessed abuse-adjacent behavior.

Eileen Guggenheim served as intermediary connecting young female art students to Epstein. Maria Farmer case demonstrates the pattern: art show → painting sale → studio space → isolation → assault.

---

## 65. Abuse Settings

Art displayed prominently in rooms where abuse occurred:
- **Massage room mural:** [EFTA00000167](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%201/EFTA00000167.pdf) — "A large painting or mural on the wall, featuring a figure in a dynamic pose"
- **Nude photographs:** FBI photos show hallways and bedrooms "lined with nude photographs and paintings of women"
- **Palm Beach testimony:** "naked pictures of girls," "mural or pictures of naked girls either exposing their breasts or completely naked" ([EFTA00009448](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%207/EFTA00009448.pdf))
- **Pink Room:** "Coming of Age Ceremony" depicting sexualized pre-teen in room used for abuse

---

## 66. Money Laundering Investigation

- 2007: Federal prosecutors opened financial-crimes investigation including potential money laundering charges
- A prosecutor wrote Epstein should be charged with money laundering and operating an unlicensed money transmitting business
- Money laundering charges ultimately not filed as part of 2008 plea deal
- Art transactions inherently opaque: no beneficial ownership registries, freeport storage, bearer-like properties
- $30.5M in 2017 auction proceeds flowed through Haze Trust to multiple downstream accounts
- Leon Black's $158M+ in "advisory fees" flowed through Southern Trust, which wired funds for art acquisitions

**Source:** [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2025-jeffrey-epstein-emails-money-laundering-charges/)

---

## 67. Power Display

- Stuart Pivar: Epstein had "preference for owning fake paintings"
- Leah Kleman: Epstein was "big into shock value"
- Art used for intimidation: prosthetic eyeballs in entryway, hanging nude in wedding dress above stairwell, prison yard mural, nude murals in abuse rooms
- Custom chess set: Epstein as King, women as other pieces
- Epstein preferred to project power through bizarre, disturbing displays rather than traditional connoisseurship

## 72. Critical Negative Findings

### Major Galleries — ZERO Results
Gagosian, Acquavella, Pace Gallery, Zwirner, Wildenstein, Perrotin, Nahmad, Mugrabi — ALL returned zero results in both redaction databases. (Note: Gagosian has 414 hits in OCR/DOJ-wide search; the redaction databases specifically are where zeros appear.)

### Art Storage — ZERO Results
Freeport, free port, Geneva Freeport, Luxembourg Freeport, art storage, art inventory — NONE in redaction databases.

### Major Artists — ZERO Results in Redaction Databases
Picasso, Warhol, Basquiat, Monet (only "Monet Banihashem" — person's name), Matisse, Chagall, Francis Bacon, Lucian Freud, Gerhard Richter, de Kooning, Pollock (only "pollocks@sec.gov"), Twombly, Klimt, Schiele, Banksy.

**Note:** Many of these artists DO appear in OCR and web sources (Picasso extensively, Matisse via lot sheet, etc.). Their absence in the redaction databases means they don't appear in redacted/hidden text — the surface-visible text likely contains these references.

### Art Terms — ZERO Results
Oil on canvas, watercolor, provenance, art dealer, art advisor, art collection, art purchase, art gallery, Impressionist — NONE returned hits in redaction databases (except specific instances noted above).

### Art Shipping — ZERO Results
Cadogan Tate, Dietl — NONE found.

## Appendix D: Unresolved Questions

1. **Who is Epstein's unnamed "art guy"?** The advisor who assessed the Salvator Mundi as "only worth 1.5m."

2. **Full 2017 auction consignments:** What specific works generated the $30.5M at Sotheby's and Christie's? The dollar amounts suggest major works.

3. **Prytanee LLC investments:** What specific art was purchased through this vehicle? Only $197K remains on balance sheet despite $1.4M reportedly deposited.

4. **Art on the island:** Is there a complete inventory from Little Saint James in the files?

5. **Art insurance policy details:** What was the total insured value? Which specific works were covered?

6. **Additional art-holding LLCs:** Beyond Narrows/AP Narrows/Narrows II/Friends Ventures, were there others?

7. **$139M Cezanne/Picasso 1031 exchanges:** What were the specific capital gains deferred?

8. **Free port storage:** Did Epstein or entities he controlled use art free ports?

9. **Origin of townhouse art:** Which pieces were Wexner's originally vs. Epstein additions?

10. **"Brinsley and Julie":** Who are these painting donors/sellers? "Brinsley" is distinctive.

11. **Complete art appraisal:** The estate "Fine Arts" line was never publicly valued. Has an internal appraisal ever been disclosed?

12. **Rothko painting provenance:** What is the specific Rothko in [EFTA01786553](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01786553.pdf)? Is it connected to the $46M Rothko exchanged for Black's Picasso, or a separate work?

13. **"Hangar Painting":** Referenced three times — what is this work and where was the hangar?

14. **Acquavella Gallery:** Web sources suggest possible transactions but no documentary evidence found.

15. **Ocean's Bridge reproduction:** What famous painting was reproduced? [EFTA01779110](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01779110.pdf) has "photos of your painting" but the original is unidentified.

## FULL CORPUS REVISIT INTEGRATION (2026-02-12)

*The following findings were identified through revisit against the full text corpus (1,380,937 docs, 2,731,796 pages, all 12 datasets) and represent corrections or expansions to the original report.*

### Collection Value Upgrade
The original report estimated the collection in hundreds of millions based on partial documentation. The full corpus reveals the collection was insured for **$1.6 billion** via a 16-layer fine arts insurance tower ([EFTA00607435](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00607435.pdf)), with documented appraised values exceeding $1 billion across all entities. Named insureds include Leon D. Black, Debra R. Black, Pent Holdings, Narrows Holdings LLC, Narrows Holdings II LLC, Black Family 1997 Trust, Black 2006 Family Trust, and LDB 2011 LLC. Annual premiums totaled $724,250.

### Complete Art Inventories Discovered
At least 5 separate comprehensive inventories are now documented: [EFTA00592228](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00592228.pdf) (ALL ART 3/19/17, Christie's 5/11/16 values), [EFTA00592858](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00592858.pdf) (ALL ART WITH BASIS 7/15/16), [EFTA00592899](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00592899.pdf) (APO-01 at Christie's values: $396M), [EFTA00593106](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00593106.pdf) (APO-01 Art to AP Narrows: $183M), and [EFTA01084294](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA01084294.pdf) (Sotheby's 2013/2014 comparison with Munch at $135M).

9. Beckmann "Selbstbildnis mit Horn" -- $42.5M (Narrows, 50% interest)
10. Picasso "Portrait de Mateu Fernandez de Soto" -- $37.5M (B Fam 1997 Trust)

### 2016 Purchases ($286.6M)
[EFTA00792629](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00792629.pdf) documents total 2016 art purchases of $286,605,000 with Christie's 2017 appraised value of $242,284,000 (unrealized loss of $44,031,000). Included Picasso "Buste de femme (Marie-Therese)" at $125.2M, Cezanne "Bouteilles, Pots..." at $54M (90% LDB 2011 LLC), and a 20+ work Dutch Masters acquisition from dealer Paul Russell for Narrows (Collateral).

### BV70 LLC (181 documents -- new finding)
BV70 LLC is an Epstein-controlled entity managed by Elysium Management at 445 Park Avenue. [EFTA00583120](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00583120.pdf): Epstein personally guaranteed BV70 obligations. [EFTA00585854](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00585854.pdf): $8M promissory note from Plan D LLC to BV70 at 1.11% interest. [EFTA00587879](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00587879.pdf): BV70 donated $10M to Gratitude America Ltd. [EFTA00080250](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00080250.pdf)/[EFTA00080260](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00080260.pdf): Deutsche Bank charts show BV70 -> Gratitude America $10M and BV70 -> Plan D $22.5M.

### Noel Calb LLC (88 documents -- new finding)
A separate art-holding entity with $57.7M in appraised art. The name "Noel Calb" is an anagram of "Leon Black." [EFTA00591815](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00591815.pdf) provides the complete inventory: Toulouse-Lautrec "Au bal de l'opera" ($10M), Rothko "Black, White, Blue" ($4M), Gauguin "Autoportrait" ($1.75M), and 40+ additional works.

### Epstein's Direct Advisory Role -- Additional Evidence
[EFTA01042767](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA01042767.pdf): Epstein email from Paris (07/07/2017): "im in paris. use your judgement, it could be a rodin or a brancusi. it should be an outdoor piece, i think that i can use inside 15-20 fot high?" -- personally selecting monumental sculptures for the collection.

### Kirchner Clarification
166 documents mention Kirchner. Many hits in the EFTA00261xxx series are false positives from unrelated Australian complaint documents mentioning a "Roger Kirchner." Core Kirchner art holdings confirmed: "Berliner Strassenszene" (Narrows, 50% interest, $45M), "Stehender Madchenakt" (AP Narrows), and "Steigendes Pferd mit Reiter" (LDB, purchased 3/31/2016 for $150K).

### Christine Gibbons Correction
3 documents. [EFTA01785536](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01785536.pdf): Gibbons was a **real estate broker** at Sotheby's International Realty for the "El Brillo" property in Palm Beach, not an art contact. Minimal art relevance.

### Negative Findings
The following individuals referenced in web sources returned zero results in the full corpus: Hela Fox, Tom Otterness, Jorge Alvarez. John F. Simon returned 1 result (minimal).
