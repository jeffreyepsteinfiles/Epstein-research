## CATEGORY 1: AUCTION HOUSES

### 1A. Sotheby's

**Analysis:** Christine Gibbons is identified as a Sotheby's employee/agent corresponding about 358 El Brillo Way, Epstein's Palm Beach estate. The second record shows a reply chain with the subject "Re: Sotheby's and..." suggesting ongoing correspondence. The `J ff E i` fragment on the same document suggests "Jeff Epstein" was mentioned.

### 1B. Christie's

**Analysis:** An email chain from September 2011 involving someone at @christies.com and a person named "Hela Fox" with references to "Catherine McIvern". The French-language date formatting ("Septembre", "Vendred[i]") suggests this correspondence may relate to Christie's Paris operations. This is dated shortly before Epstein's activities in France.

### 1C. Auction Houses (General)

| [EFTA00036332](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00036332.pdf) | 0 | v2 | `VIEW AUCTIONS` |

**Analysis:** The NYTimes article "Auction Houses Seek a Competitive Edge" being forwarded via email (dated 2014) shows active interest in the auction world. The "Auction House" reference in context of "Whistleblower Says Abuses" is particularly notable -- this appears in an intelligence/investigative document.

### 1D. Bonhams / Heritage Auctions / Phillips (auction context)
**No results found** in either database for Bonhams, Heritage Auctions, or Phillips in auction context (Phillips results were all in exhibition context -- see below).

## CATEGORY 2: PAINTINGS AND ARTWORK

### 2A. Specific Paintings Referenced

| EFTA Number | Page | Database | Hidden Text (excerpt) |
|-------------|------|----------|----------------------|

| [EFTA02096203](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA02096203.pdf) | 0 | v2, ds10 | `painting?` |

**Analysis:**
- **Rothko painting** -- A dedicated email about a Mark Rothko painting. Rothko works routinely sell for $10M-$80M+. This is one of the most significant art finds.
- **"PALMS PAINTING"** -- likely refers to a painting at one of Epstein's island or Palm Beach properties.
- **"Hangar Painting"** -- Three separate emails reference a "Hangar Painting." **Correction (2026-02-12):** Full corpus search (22 documents, DS9:14, DS10:6, DS11:2) reveals these are Little Saint James construction progress reports. [EFTA00922416](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00922416.pdf): "Hangar -- painting continues, floor scheduled for next week, arranging shipping of refurbished ISO tank." This refers to painting the TWA Hangar building during renovation, not a painting artwork. [EFTA01118691](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA01118691.pdf) contains "TWA Hangar Costs" spreadsheets covering Sep 2011-May 2012.
- **"Painting from Brinsley and Julie arrived"** -- **Correction (2026-02-12):** Full corpus search (71 documents, DS9:32, DS10:29, DS11:10) identifies these individuals as **Julie Loquidis and Brinsley Burbidge**, former Little Saint James employees. [EFTA00312740](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00312740.pdf): Their Feb 2012 letter to Epstein describes opening a photography gallery/studio in Cottage Grove, Oregon. Staff to-do items include "keep eye out for painting from Brinsley & Julie" ([EFTA00419291](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00419291.pdf)). A personnel file heading reads "Concerns re Purchasing Practices of Julie and Brinsley" ([EFTA00299879](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00299879.pdf)). They were former island staff and photographers, not art-world figures.
- **Ocean's Bridge** -- This is a company (OceansBridge.com) that creates hand-painted museum-quality reproductions of famous paintings. The email subject "photos of your painting" confirms Epstein commissioned a reproduction painting.

### 2B. Painting Proposals and Commissions

**Analysis:** Two emails in a "painting proposal" thread suggest Epstein was actively commissioning artwork.

### 2C. Shipping Paintings from Paris

| EFTA Number | Page | Database | Hidden Text (excerpt) |
|-------------|------|----------|----------------------|
| [EFTA02125762](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA02125762.pdf) | 1 | v2, ds10 | `ct: Quote for Shipping Painting from Pari[s]` |

**Analysis:** A chain of at least 4-5 emails about getting quotes to ship a painting from Paris. The painting is described as "framed and va[lued at...]" -- the valuation was redacted but its mention suggests significant worth requiring insurance documentation for transit. This connects directly to Epstein's Paris apartment at 22 Avenue Foch.

### 2D. Invoice for Paris Artwork

| EFTA Number | Page | Database | Hidden Text (excerpt) |
|-------------|------|----------|----------------------|
| [EFTA01744564](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01744564.pdf) | 0 | v2, ds10 | `t: Invoice for Paris Artwork` |

**Analysis:** A direct invoice for artwork in Paris, confirming financial transactions for art at the Paris property.

### 2E. Artwork References (General)

## CATEGORY 3: SCULPTURE AND THREE-DIMENSIONAL ART

### 3A. Sculpture

| EFTA Number | Page | Database | Hidden Text (excerpt) |
|-------------|------|----------|----------------------|
| [EFTA01789377](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01789377.pdf) | 0 | v2, ds10 | `Objet: Re: reat Island / sculpture from Ne[w York]` |

**Analysis:** An email about a sculpture being sent from New York to "Great Island" (likely Great St. James Island, Epstein's private island in the USVI). The French word "Objet" in the subject line suggests French-speaking correspondence, consistent with Epstein's Paris connections.

### 3B. Bronzes (Art Insurance Context)

| EFTA Number | Page | Database | Hidden Text (excerpt) |
|-------------|------|----------|----------------------|
| [EFTA01896117](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01896117.pdf) | 0 | v2, ds10 | `It's included in the art insurance payment There is no separ[ate bill]` |

| [EFTA01896183](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01896183.pdf) | 0 | v2, ds10 | `ust tons and tons of bills` |
| [EFTA01896243](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01896243.pdf) | 0 | v2, ds10 | `Just tons an tons o[f] i[ll]s` |

**Analysis:** Four variants of the same email confirm that Epstein maintained an **art insurance policy** that specifically covered **bronze sculptures**. The phrase "just tons and tons of bills" and "there is no separate bill for the bronzes" indicates the bronzes were bundled into a larger art insurance payment. These are likely different redaction captures of the same email chain.

> **Full corpus update (2026-02-12):** Full corpus search reveals **105 documents** referencing "art insurance" (DS9:77, DS10:20, DS11:8). The complete April 5, 2013 email chain is now recovered: **Melanie Spinella** (Epstein staff) to **Jeffrey Epstein** (jeevacation@gmail.com) confirms bronzes covered under art insurance. Epstein then asks: "eileen said that there are no bronzes" -- contradicting Spinella. Epstein further asks: "are there apprasails, cost value" -- seeking appraisals. The "Eileen" referenced in the no-bronzes claim is **Eileen Alexanderson** (not Guggenheim), who was CC'd when Epstein requested a copy of the insurance policy.

### 3C. Degas' "Little Dancer, Aged Fourteen"

| EFTA Number | Page | Database | Hidden Text (excerpt) |
|-------------|------|----------|----------------------|
| [EFTA01734425](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01734425.pdf) | 0 | v2, ds10 | `Grc7ory Hedberg / DEGAS' / LITTLE / DANCER, / AGED / FOURTEEN / ;he onrCer 'trio/ / that helped tpa[rk] / the birth / Mudent ref` |

**Analysis:** HIGHLY SIGNIFICANT. This is a reference to the book "Degas' Little Dancer, Aged Fourteen: The Earlier Version That Helped Spark the Birth of Modern Art" by Gregory Hedberg. This book documents the discovery of an earlier version of Degas' famous sculpture "La Petite Danseuse de Quatorze Ans." The presence of this document in Epstein's files suggests either: (a) Epstein owned or was interested in acquiring a version of this sculpture, (b) it was sent to him as reference material related to an art transaction, or (c) it was found among his possessions. The subject matter -- a sculpture of a fourteen-year-old girl -- takes on disturbing resonance given Epstein's crimes.

## CATEGORY 4: ARTISTS REFERENCED

### 4A. Rothko (Mark Rothko)

| EFTA Number | Page | Database | Hidden Text (excerpt) |

**Analysis:** Direct email about a Rothko painting. Rothko is among the most valuable artists at auction, with works regularly exceeding $50 million.

### 4B. Renoir (Pierre-Auguste Renoir)

| EFTA Number | Page | Database | Hidden Text (excerpt) |

**Analysis:** Appears alongside Degas and in Impressionist art context (see Impressionist section below).

### 4C. Degas (Edgar Degas)

### 4E. Impressionist Art Context ([EFTA02020466](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA02020466.pdf), pages 37-40)

This document contains concentrated references to major Impressionist artists across multiple pages:

| Page | Fragments Found |
|------|----------------|
| 37 | `Cezanne`, `Paul C[ezanne]`, `ch artis[t]`, `eautifu[l]`, `n Atlant[ic]` |
| 38 | `Renoir`, `Degas`, `amille` (Camille Pissarro?), `Bonn[ard]`, `Augus[te]`, `ionists` (Impressionists), `influe[nce]`, `hilde` |
| 39 | `Ann L`, `m Beach`, `5 100`, `ventio[n]` (convention?) |
| 40 | `on dealer R[oss]`, `& Ross`, `et New`, `Facing th[e]` |

**Analysis:** This appears to be a document about Impressionist art -- possibly a gallery catalog, auction preview, or art reference document discussing Cezanne, Renoir, Degas, and likely Bonnard and Camille Pissarro. The reference to "Impressionists" confirms the art context. The fragments "dealer R & Ross" and "Palm Beach" suggest a Palm Beach art dealer or gallery context.

### 4F. Tracey Emin

| EFTA Number | Page | Database | Hidden Text (excerpt) |

| [EFTA01387134](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01387134.pdf) | 0 | v2, ds10 | Same |

**Analysis:** Four separate documents reference Tracey Emin's 2018 work "Another World" with the copyright notice "the artist Courtesy Tracey Emin Studio." Tracey Emin is a major British contemporary artist.

> **Full corpus update (2026-02-12):** Expanded to **13 documents** (DS9:6, DS10:5, DS11:2). These are Deutsche Bank Wealth Management invitations to Frieze London/Masters art fairs sent to Epstein's DB accounts. An Intelligence Squared event ticket was also sent to jeevacation@gmail.com (Apr 2019). The documents are marketing materials, not legal or investigative documents.

### 4G. Koons (Jeff Koons)

| EFTA Number | Page | Database | Hidden Text (excerpt) |
|-------------|------|----------|----------------------|
| [EFTA01720503](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01720503.pdf) | 51 | v2, ds10 | `1_ , Koons` |

**Analysis:** A reference to "Koons" appears in a document at page 51. The fragment is brief but appears in a context separated from other text, suggesting it could be a name in a list, contact list, or art inventory.

### 4H. Artists NOT Found in Redaction Databases
The following artists returned **zero results** in both redaction databases:
- Picasso, Warhol, Basquiat, Hirst (Damien), Botero, Monet (only "Monet Banihashem" -- a person's name), Matisse, Chagall, Francis Bacon, Lucian Freud, Gerhard Richter, de Kooning, Pollock (only "pollocks@sec.gov"), Twombly, Klimt, Schiele, Banksy

> **Full corpus update (2026-02-12):** The zero results for these artists were an artifact of searching only redaction text layers. The full corpus contains: Matisse **84 documents**, Rothko **117**, Giacometti **316**, Jeff Koons **373**, Andres Serrano **353**, Andy Warhol **96**, Mondrian **75**, Kirchner **166**, Brancusi **40**, Schwitters **75**.

**Analysis:** "AVEL GALLERY JUPITER FL" refers to a gallery in Jupiter, Florida, near Palm Beach. The "Gallery Building, Carrer Ester" reference suggests a gallery in Spain (Carrer = street in Catalan). The "galleries, gallery listings" on [EFTA01954050](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01954050.pdf) with a "studio in Notting Hill" reference places this in London art scene context.

### 5B. Phillips Exhibition

**Analysis:** Two separate documents reference a "Phillips Exhibition - Loan Request" -- this is "[Ric]hard Phillips Exhibition - Loan Request." Richard Phillips is a contemporary American artist known for hyper-realistic portrait paintings. The "Loan Request" format indicates that Epstein was being asked to loan artwork he owned for a Richard Phillips exhibition, confirming Epstein owned Richard Phillips artwork.

> **Full corpus update (2026-02-12):** Expanded to **8 documents** (DS9:2, DS10:2, DS11:4). The full loan agreement is now visible: **Erin Cluley** at Dallas Contemporary contacted **Lesley Groff** (Epstein staff). The exhibition was "Negation of the Universe," April-August 2014. The intermediary is now identified.

**Analysis:** Eileen Guggenheim, connected to the Guggenheim family, appears repeatedly as a named Epstein associate alongside Trump, Prince Andrew, Dershowitz, Wexner, Glenn & Eva Dubin, Richard Branson, and the Maxwells.

> **Full corpus update (2026-02-12):** Guggenheim expanded from 3 redaction database records to **208 documents** (DS9:90, DS10:88, DS11:30) in the full corpus. The full corpus reveals her role as an FBI witness: [EFTA00269752](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00269752.pdf) (FBI 302 interview, Sep 11, 2007) shows Guggenheim was NYAA Chairman, Epstein was board member 1980s-1990s, NYAA students were sent to Zorro Ranch for "art workshop on the human figure," and a victim returned from Epstein's Ohio residence "very upset." Direct correspondence ([EFTA00356353](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00356353.pdf), Dec 2014): Guggenheim emails Epstein: "I feel guilty -- I have forgotten to find an Academy artist for you to paint the entranceway of your house." This transforms Guggenheim from a name on a list to a documented FBI witness who continued active contact with Epstein through at least 2014 -- seven years after her FBI interview about his sexual exploitation of minors.

## CATEGORY 6: ART DEALERS AND LUXURY CONNECTIONS

### 6A. Gagosian, Acquavella, Pace, Zwirner, Wildenstein, Perrotin, Nahmad, Mugrabi
**All returned ZERO results** in both redaction databases.

> **Full corpus update (2026-02-12):** Gagosian appears in **449 documents** across the full corpus (DS9:243, DS10:78, DS11:128). Acquavella appears in **16 documents** (DS9:10, DS11:6). The zero results in the redaction databases reflect the limited scope of searching only text layers beneath redacted areas; the full text corpus captures substantially more.

**Analysis:** "Graff Ilan (USANYS)" is a US Attorney's office reference, not the luxury dealer. "Scott Graff" appears to be a person discussed in emails involving Jeanne Brennan and Daphne Wallace (known Epstein staff). Not connected to Graff Diamonds.

### 6C. Atelier Meriguet (French Decorative Arts)

**Analysis:** SIGNIFICANT. Atelier Meriguet-Carrere is one of France's most prestigious decorative arts firms, specializing in restoration of historic interiors, gilding, and decorative painting for palaces, embassies, and luxury residences. A catalog was requested to be sent to **22 Avenue Foch** -- Epstein's Paris apartment -- in 2014. This confirms Epstein was actively furnishing/decorating his Paris property with high-end decorative arts.

**Analysis:** Confirmed that Epstein maintained a dedicated **art insurance policy** that covered bronze sculptures among other art. The statement that there is "no separate bill for the bronzes" (they are bundled into the art insurance payment) indicates a comprehensive art collection being insured as a portfolio.

**Analysis:** A $13,000,000 appraisal for the 71st Street NYC mansion (dated July 24, 2019 -- just days after Epstein's arrest on July 6, 2019) and an appraisal request for 358 El Brillo Way (Palm Beach). While these are property appraisals, they would typically include contents/art as part of the valuation.

**Analysis:** Extensive documentation of Leon Black as both a personal associate (lunches, appointments, visits to his house with someone named "Karyna") and as a subject of federal investigation ("Additional HT Subject Referral," "DANY call on Leon Black," "Leon Black Inquiry," "Epstein/Maxwell/Leon Black/Additional Subject"). The "DANY" reference is the Manhattan District Attorney. Given Black's position as one of the world's foremost art collectors, his relationship with Epstein may have involved art transactions or art-related financial advice.

**Analysis:** Wexner is extensively referenced as Epstein's primary financial patron. The art connection is explicit in [EFTA01653098](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01653098.pdf) where someone created "artwork" for a proposed (ultimately abandoned) "fake lawsuit against Leslie Wexner." The investigative summaries note Epstein "earned his money from Wexner."

**Analysis:** Mort Zuckerman (media mogul, Boston Properties chairman) had multiple social engagements with Epstein (dinners, breakfasts). Epstein reportedly managed Zuckerman's finances. No explicit art references found in the Zuckerman records, but the financial relationship would have potentially included oversight of Zuckerman's assets.

**Analysis:** The first record -- "we need someone to put the canvas on the ceiling" -- could refer to either a canvas art installation on a ceiling or a canvas covering/fabric. Given the art context of these files, a ceiling canvas installation is plausible. Harbor Marine Canvas is a marine/boat canvas company.

**Analysis:** "Artistic Lives" appears in a 2013 email about inviting someone to dinners/parties "with Jeffrey and..." -- this could be a BBC program reference or an art organization. "Artistic WhistleBlower" is the sender of a forwarded message, likely a tipster using a pseudonym.

**Analysis:** This appears to be an interior finish/materials specification document listing marble, basswood, and laminate options -- likely for one of Epstein's properties.
