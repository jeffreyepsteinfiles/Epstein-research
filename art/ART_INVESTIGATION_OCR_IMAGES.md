## 1. AUCTION HOUSE TRANSACTIONS

> **Full corpus update:** Sotheby's expanded from approximately 3 OCR records to **906 documents** (DS9:433, DS10:258, DS11:211). Christie's expanded from approximately 7 OCR records to **1,438 documents** (DS9:765, DS10:221, DS11:445). See also Section 19 for the complete art inventory with Christie's appraised values.

### Sotheby's -- Paris Chair Consignment (2011)

**[EFTA02323094](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02323094.pdf)** / **[EFTA02323077](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02323077.pdf)** (multiple OCR records: 10031, 10230, 19265, 23064, 32402, 33678, 37412, 37903)

A detailed email chain between Epstein's staff and **Lily D. Snyder** of Sotheby's Private Client Group regarding the consignment and auction of **two mahogany armchairs, circa 1830** from Epstein's Paris residence.

Key details:
- "Jeffrey has 2 of these chairs in Paris which he wishes to auction off"
- Estimated value: **10-15,000 euros**
- Sotheby's Paris specialist created consignment and contract
- Two accounts associated: one at **457 Madison** and a second address
- Staff email: "We would like to put these chairs in the Paris spring 2010 auction. What would be the next step?"
- Photos were sent (image001.jpg through image006.jpg)
- Contact: Alejandra Rossetti at Sotheby's

### Christie's -- Epstein Staff Contacts (2011)

**[EFTA02323043](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02323043.pdf)** (OCR record 24002)

Email from Epstein staff member learning how to use auction houses:

> "do you have contact info for Sotheby's or Christies? I have a bunch of things for auction at 71st and I've never done it before. I think JE has/had an account with each place, but not sure of the procedure"

Response provides direct contacts:
- **Christie's NY**: Joanna Ostrem and Madeline Lazaris (office numbers provided)
- **Sotheby's**: contact and office number provided
- "The best way to start is to send pictures of the items you want to sell. From there, they will pass the items on to the various **appraisal departments** to get estimated auction prices"

### Richard Kahn Email -- Christie's Picasso Damage (2018)

**[EFTA02664945](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02664945.pdf)** (OCR record 8799)

Richard Kahn (HBRK Associates Inc., 575 Lexington Avenue, 4th Floor, New York) forwarded Epstein a Page Six article:

> "another christies disaster.. https://pagesix.com/2018/05/16/steve-wynn-furious-at-christies-for-damaging-his-picasso-masterpiece/"

This confirms Epstein's social circle was actively discussing high-value art market events and that Kahn communicated art news to Epstein.

## 2. HAZE TRUST AUCTION PROCEEDS -- $30.5M+ in 2017

**[EFTA00027019](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00027019.pdf)** (OCR records 4731, 18253)

**EXHIBIT D: TRANSACTIONS INVOLVING THE HAZE TRUST ACCOUNTS** -- This is the most significant financial art document in the corpus. It shows massive auction proceeds flowing into Epstein-controlled accounts:

| Date | Payer | Recipient | Amount |
|------|-------|-----------|--------|
| **6/19/2017** | **Christie's Inc** | The Haze Trust Checking | **$7,725,000** |
| **9/25/2017** | **Sotheby's** | The Haze Trust Checking | **$11,536,544** |
| **10/24/2017** | **Sotheby's** | The Haze Trust Checking | **$11,249,417** |

**TOTAL AUCTION PROCEEDS IN 2017: $30,510,961**

This confirms the known $30.5M in auction proceeds in a single year, broken down as:
- **Christie's**: $7.725M (June 2017)
- **Sotheby's**: $22.786M across two payments (September and October 2017)

The Haze Trust subsequently moved these funds:
- 3/10/2017: $36M from Haze Trust Brokerage to Checking, then $35.999M to DBAGNY

### "Jackson Pollock Chocolate Drip" -- Vic Munoz / Christie's

**[EFTA02474944](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02474944.pdf)** (OCR record 14383)

Email from Jeffrey Epstein (jeevacation@gmail.com) on April 11, 2018:

> "its the jackson pollack choclate drip must be in a catalogue but will have someone photo thx"

The correspondent asks about the size and offers advice on avoiding glare when photographing. The email footer references Christie's website and **LotFinder(R)** -- Christie's online search engine -- and mentions **Christie's Live(TM)** internet bidding. The subject line is "Vic Munoz."

### Picasso Sculpture -- Contested Ownership (Leon Black)

**[EFTA02730996](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2012/EFTA02730996.pdf)** (OCR record 4054)

The Apollo Conflicts Committee / Dechert LLP report identifies that Epstein advised Leon Black on "**(ii) the contested ownership of a Picasso sculpture**" -- indicating there was a Picasso sculpture with disputed provenance in Black's collection that Epstein was actively involved in.

### Paris Paintings -- Photo CD Labeled "PAINTING"

**[EFTA00004250](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%203/EFTA00004250.pdf)** (Image analysis records 4235, 4253, 4255)

## 4. LEON BLACK'S $1B+ ART COLLECTION -- Epstein's Advisory Role

### Apollo Conflicts Committee / Dechert LLP Report

**[EFTA02730996](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2012/EFTA02730996.pdf)** (OCR record 4054)

The report states Epstein advised Black on "**myriad esoteric issues**" including:

> **(i) managing Black's artwork, (ii) advising on issues relating to Black's yacht, and (iii) advising on issues relating to Black's airplane**

Section titled **"Managing Black's Artwork"**:

> "Family Office witnesses generally agreed that Epstein advised Black in a few areas related to Black's artwork, including: **(i) the formation of a new art partnership, (ii) the contested ownership of a Picasso sculpture, (iii) Black's art loans, (iv) like-kind exchanges, and (v) obtaining a potential advisory opinion from the New York State Department of Taxation and Finance** regarding a contemplated transaction involving Black's art."

> "Although Family Office employees generally agreed that Epstein was not an expert in art management or art law, witnesses also opined that he was helpful in the formation of the art partnership and was **fairly involved in assisting Black in connection with the sale of certain pieces of artwork**."

### Senate Finance Committee (Sen. Ron Wyden) -- Interrogatories

**[EFTA02731023](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2012/EFTA02731023.pdf)** (OCR records 16698, 26164, 28989, 37024)

Senator Ron Wyden's letters to Leon Black include detailed questions about art:

Question 15 (from OCR record 16698):
> "In a briefing with the Committee on August 1, 2022, your outside counsel indicated that **Epstein provided substantial advice related to your private art collection, which is worth over $1 billion**. This advice reportedly included helping you form a new art partnership as well as assistance in connection with the sale of certain pieces of artwork."

Sub-questions demanded:
- (a) Purpose of the new art partnership and Epstein's role
- (b) Details on **art loans** involving Epstein
- (c) List of **like-kind exchange transactions** for pieces valued over $1 million, with tax benefits obtained
- (d) List of **art sales valued at over $1 million** Epstein assisted with

From OCR record 37024:
> "Committee staff submitted a second set of questions regarding Epstein's compensation scheme. These questions also inquired about **advice Epstein provided in relation to your private art collection, which your outside counsel confirmed in a briefing has a value of more than $1 billion**. Again, you refused to provide answers to those questions."

> **Full corpus update:** Beyond the Dechert report, full corpus search reveals **Elysium Management** (Leon Black's family office) at 2,458 documents, **AP Narrows LP** at 218 documents, and explicit co-ownership annotations in [EFTA00592228](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00592228.pdf): "LDB owns 50%" of Kirchner's "Street Scene" ($50M) and Beckmann's "The Actors" ($40M). See Section 19 for the full inventory and Section 23 for the Narrows/Pent Holdings entities.

### Leon Black -- Art Gallery for a Woman

**[EFTA02731697](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2012/EFTA02731697.pdf)** (OCR record 2720)

Email from Jeanne M. Christensen (Partner, Wigdor LLP) dated June 7, 2021:

> "I made some progress on one of the women that allegedly had a relationship with Leon Black for whom **he helped start an art gallery** (at least he told my client that he had done so)"

Entity details provided:
- Located at **237 Lafayette Street #6E, New York, NY 10012**
- Entity Type: DOMESTIC LIMITED LIABILITY COMPANY
- Current Entity Status: **INACTIVE -- Dissolution (Sep 06, 2018)**

## 5. ART CONSULTANT CONNECTIONS

### John Kendall Rowlands -- Art Historian / Art Collector

**[EFTA00024431](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00024431.pdf)** (OCR record 36160)

A letter from **David Rowlands** dated August 26, 2019, forwarded through SDNY channels:

> "My late father **John Kendall Rowlands was an art historian and art collector**. He assisted Jeffrey Epstein in **sourcing and disposing of works of art** and may very well have **loaned items to him** as well. I understand that Jeffrey Epstein **owed him a substantial sum of money in consultation fees** in relation to works of art and that I would therefore have a claim on the estate in consideration of this."

> "My father did mention in passing **the presence of young girls** with Jeffrey Epstein and had he not sadly died I expect my father would have reported his concerns to the relevant authorities."

This is a significant document: it establishes that Epstein employed professional art historians/collectors to source and dispose of artworks, owed substantial fees for these services, and that an art consultant personally witnessed the presence of underage girls.

### Christie's Emerging Artist Project (2010)

**[EFTA02532943](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02532943.pdf)** (OCR record 37072)

Email from an associate to Epstein, November 12, 2010:

> "I'm looking at **young emerging artist's and hyper realist art**, for a project to **build a emerging artist collection and one private one**. I was **Christie's yesterday for lunch** and something they want me to do. Lot's of balls seem to be in the air, how many I catch will remain to be seen."

This shows active art collection building through Christie's contacts as late as 2010.

---

## 6. STAFF ART MANAGEMENT OPERATIONS

### LinkedIn Resume -- Epstein Estate Manager

**[EFTA00038908](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00038908.pdf)** (OCR record 17805)

A LinkedIn profile (archived 2019) for a senior Epstein employee describes:

> - "**Arrange for the purchasing, delivery and restoration of furniture, antiques and art for the estates.**"
> - "**Act as an authoritative liaison with auction houses, such as Christie's and Sotheby's.**"
> - "Recruited, managed and coordinated a staff of approximately **40 people for 7 personal estates worldwide**"
> - "**Arrange for the shipping, crating, purchasing and restoration of furniture, antiques, art and household items for the estates.**"
> - "**Responsible for maintaining insurance policy and files for all purchases**, including automobiles"
> - "6 years 4 months" employment duration

This establishes a dedicated professional infrastructure for art acquisition, restoration, shipping, crating, insurance, and auction house liaison across all seven Epstein properties worldwide.

## 7. ZUCKERMAN ART INVENTORY

**[EFTA02518881](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02518881.pdf)** (OCR record 15302)

Email from Jeffrey Epstein (jeevacation@gmail.com) to **Mortimer Zuckerman** and **Clare Probert**, December 15, 2013:

> "Please have kris put together. All trusts, past three year tax returns, latest will grats crts pledges **art inventory** bxp filings daily news financial statements, phone contact for Ellen, all tax preparers, Morgan Stanley last report etc"

This confirms Epstein was directly controlling and managing Zuckerman's **art inventory** alongside trusts, tax returns, wills, BXP filings (Brookfield/Boston Properties), and Daily News financials. This represents an extraordinary level of control over another billionaire's personal financial and art assets.

---

## 8. AUCTIONATA / PADDLES -- Nicole Junkermann

**[EFTA02664994](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02664994.pdf)** (OCR record 20036)

Email exchange between Jeffrey Epstein and **Nicole Junkermann** (Junkermann Group), December 29, 2016:

**Junkermann:** "Interesting situation around this company [Auctionata/Paddles] would you like to hear more or not interested?"

**Epstein:** "always interested in anything you are"

**Context:** Auctionata was a Berlin-based online auction platform that had merged with Paddle8 (a New York online auction house) in October 2016. The combined entity collapsed in early 2017 amid allegations of sham bidding and financial impropriety. This email shows Epstein was being presented with opportunities in the online art auction technology space through Junkermann, and that Epstein connected Junkermann to Leon Black (see [EFTA02435071](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02435071.pdf): "I spoke to Leon Black... He said he will take you to lunch or dinner, and be any help he can").

---

## 9. ESTATE VALUATION -- Fine Arts "TBD Subject to Appraisal"

### Petition for Probate and Letters Testamentary

**[EFTA00027979](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00027979.pdf)** (OCR record 25995)

The Epstein estate filing lists personal property totaling **$577,672,654.00**:

| Category | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Cash | $56,547,773 |
| Fixed Income Investments | $14,304,679 |
| Equities | $112,679,138 |
| Aviation, Automobiles, Boats | $18,551,700 |
| **Fine Arts, Antiques, Collectibles, Valuables & Other Personal Property** | **TBD subject to appraisal/valuation** |
| Hedge Funds & Private Equity | $194,986,301 |
| Maple Inc. (NYC townhouse) | $55,931,000 |
| SCI JEP (Paris units) | $8,672,823 |
| Poplar Inc. (Great St. James) | $22,498,600 |
| Nautilus Inc. (Little St. James) | $63,874,223 |

The **"Fine Arts, Antiques, Collectibles"** line remains **"TBD subject to appraisal/valuation"** -- meaning the art collection was never publicly valued in the probate filing.

### GVI First Amended Complaint

**[EFTA00018778](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00018778.pdf)** (OCR record 29840)

The Government of the Virgin Islands confirmed:

> "The Estate has **not yet valued his fine arts, antiques, and other valuables**."

Given the $30.5M in auction proceeds in 2017 alone, and the Sotheby's Matisse lot sheet, the art collection was likely worth tens of millions of dollars or more.

> **Full corpus update:** The estate's "TBD subject to appraisal" notation was misleading. [EFTA00592228](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00592228.pdf) (DS9) contains a complete "ALL ART - 3/19/17" inventory spreadsheet with Christie's appraised values dated 5/11/2016, totaling **$558M+** in named artworks. Detailed appraisals existed well before the estate filing. See Section 19 for the full inventory.

---

## 10. ART AS GROOMING TOOL -- "Patron of the Arts"

### Panish Shea & Boyle Complaint

**[EFTA00019101](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00019101.pdf)** (OCR record 2000)

A legal complaint describes how Epstein and Maxwell used art patronage as a grooming mechanism:

> "Epstein bragged to her about being **a patron of the arts and giving scholarships to talented young artists** like Doe. Epstein and Maxwell probed her at length about her background, family situation and where she lived."

> "Epstein first spoke with Doe's mother about how he **mentors young kids and provides scholarships for the arts**. He requested to speak to Doe and invited her and her mother to his mansion in Palm Beach."

> "Over the course of the next several months, Epstein and Maxwell attempted to **groom and mentor 13-year-old Jane Doe**. Epstein gave himself the name of Doe's 'godfather' while Maxwell acted like an older sister."

This establishes that Epstein weaponized his art patron identity to gain access to minors and their families.

## 11. 71st STREET TOWNHOUSE -- Art & Decor Inventory from FBI Search Photos

The image analysis database contains extensive FBI search photos from 9 East 71st Street ([EFTA00000001](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%201/EFTA00000001.pdf) through approximately [EFTA00001500](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%201/EFTA00001500.pdf)+). The following art and decorative items were documented:

### Stairwell Sculpture -- Figure Hanging from Rope

**[EFTA00000057](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%201/EFTA00000057.pdf)** (Image record 57) -- "A statue of a child hanging from a rope in the center of the image. The child appears to be a boy with light skin, wearing a white outfit."

**[EFTA00000919](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%201/EFTA00000919.pdf)** (Image record 917) -- "A sculpture of a woman in a white dress hanging from a rope"

**[EFTA00000920](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%201/EFTA00000920.pdf)** (Image record 918) -- "A person hanging from a rope in the air, wearing a white outfit"

**[EFTA00000928](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%201/EFTA00000928.pdf)** (Image record 926) -- "A person hanging from the staircase, suspended by a rope"

**[EFTA00000930](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%201/EFTA00000930.pdf)** (Image record 928) -- "A statue or sculpture of a person wearing a wedding dress, hanging from a rope"

**[EFTA00000988](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%201/EFTA00000988.pdf)** (Image record 986) -- "A figure hanging from a noose, wearing a white wedding dress with lace detailing. The figure has greenish skin and is suspended in the air."

This is the notorious sculpture in Epstein's stairwell, photographed from multiple angles during the FBI search.

### Ceiling Mural -- Cloudy Sky

**[EFTA00000057](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%201/EFTA00000057.pdf), [EFTA00000130](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%201/EFTA00000130.pdf), [EFTA00000820](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%201/EFTA00000820.pdf), [EFTA00000919](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%201/EFTA00000919.pdf), [EFTA00000927](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%201/EFTA00000927.pdf), [EFTA00000929](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%201/EFTA00000929.pdf), [EFTA00000930](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%201/EFTA00000930.pdf)** (multiple records)

A large **ceiling mural depicting a cloudy sky** with a golden border was documented throughout the main stairwell area. Described variously as "a large mural or painting on the ceiling depicting a cloudy sky with a golden border" and "a large painting on the wall depicting a cloudy sky."

### Japanese/Asian Landscape Paintings

- **[EFTA00032419](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00032419.pdf)** (OCR 13722): "These guys want to help auction Jeffrey Epstein's property... 'A little cheeky, no?'"

## 16. WEXNER ART CONNECTION

### Vanity Fair Profile

**[EFTA00013640](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00013640.pdf)** (OCR record 15941)

> "Epstein's current residence in Manhattan -- a 45,000-square-foot eight-story mansion on East 71st Street -- was originally bought by Wexner for $13 million in 1989. Wexner poured many millions into a full gut renovation, then turned it over to Epstein in 1995 after he got married."

### Wexner-Epstein Financial Relationship

**[EFTA02731082](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2012/EFTA02731082.pdf)** (OCR record 25161)

> "Epstein handled Wexner's personal business affairs until 2007, when Wexner learned that Epstein had stolen or otherwise misappropriated several hundred million dollars from Wexner... Epstein frequently bought property on behalf of the Wexners and then sold it to himself for a fraction of the cost."

While no specific art transactions between Wexner and Epstein are documented in the corpus, Wexner is known as a major art collector (co-founder of the Wexner Center for the Arts at Ohio State University), and Epstein's total financial control over Wexner's affairs would have encompassed art-related assets.

Email from Ariane de Rothschild to Jeffrey Epstein, April 19, 2015:

> "Fyi, **Michael Douglas's house in Palma de Mallorca is for sale at Sotheby's**. Really one of the most beautiful properties I have seen in the Mediterranean."

**Total appraised value of listed works: $558M+** (the spreadsheet may continue beyond the extracted text).

**Ownership entities identified:**
- **"LDB" = Leon D. Black** -- confirming Epstein/Black co-ownership of specific artworks

## 20. GIACOMETTI / BRAQUE -- $30M PURCHASE
*(Section added 2026-02-12 from full corpus search)*

The full corpus contains **316 documents** referencing Giacometti, entirely absent from the OCR and image databases.

### $25M Giacometti + $5M Braque Purchase

## 21. GAGOSIAN GALLERY
*(Section added 2026-02-12 from full corpus search)*

Gagosian returned zero results in the OCR and image databases. The full corpus contains **449 documents** (DS9:243, DS10:78, DS11:128).

**[EFTA00411612](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00411612.pdf)** (DS9): Documents a NYAA "John Richardson, Picasso Tour" event held at Gagosian Gallery, connecting the New York Academy of Art institutional network to the gallery.

## 22. EILEEN GUGGENHEIM / NYAA -- FBI WITNESS
*(Section added 2026-02-12 from full corpus search)*

Not mentioned in the original OCR/Images report. Full corpus totals: Eileen Guggenheim **476 documents** (DS9:225, DS10:175, DS11:75); NYAA **540 documents** (DS9:235, DS10:262, DS11:43).

### FBI 302 Interview

**[EFTA00269752](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00269752.pdf)** (DS9): FBI interview of Eileen Guggenheim (September 11, 2007), NYAA Chairman:
- Interviewed "pursuant to a federal investigation regarding the sexual exploitation of minors"
- Epstein was NYAA board member during the 1980s-1990s
- Epstein was "social acquaintance with artist Andy Warhol"
- A victim-artist traveled to Epstein's Ohio residence and returned "very upset"
- NYAA students were sent to Zorro Ranch for "art workshop on the human figure"

The "patron of the arts" grooming pipeline documented in Section 10 ([EFTA00019101](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00019101.pdf)) connects directly to this NYAA institutional channel: Epstein used his board position to recruit students to his ranch under the pretext of art workshops.

### Stuart Pivar -- FBI Interview and Unsolicited Defense

## 23. AP NARROWS LP / PENT HOLDINGS -- ART INVESTMENT ENTITIES

| John Kendall Rowlands | 1 | **2** | Art historian -- no expansion beyond DS8/DS10; minimal footprint despite sourcing/disposing art and being owed "substantial" fees |

### Rowlands -- Notable Absence

Despite being named in Section 5 as a key art figure who "sourced and disposed art" for Epstein and was owed "substantial" fees, Rowlands appears in only **2 documents** across the entire 1.38M-document corpus (DS8:1, DS10:1). This could indicate most Rowlands dealings were conducted verbally, his records were among those not seized, or he used a different name/title in correspondence.

*Investigation compiled from 53+ database queries across OCR text extraction database (38,955 records) and image catalog database (26,721 records). The financial transaction database was empty (0 bytes) and could not be queried. Full corpus revisit (2026-02-12) searched 1,380,937 documents across all 12 datasets; financial documents that the empty transaction DB missed are now captured, including complete Haze Trust transaction exhibits ([EFTA00080260](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00080260.pdf)) with $30.5M art auction proceeds and subsequent flows.*
