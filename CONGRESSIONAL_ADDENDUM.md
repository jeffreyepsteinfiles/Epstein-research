# CONGRESSIONAL ADDENDUM: Corrections, MCC Death Investigation, and 2025 FBI Review
## Supplement to the [CONGRESSIONAL_READING_GUIDE.md](CONGRESSIONAL_READING_GUIDE.md)

**Date:** February 12, 2026
**Purpose:** Three categories of information that emerged AFTER the original Congressional Reading Guide and [Follow-Up](CONGRESSIONAL_FOLLOWUP_NEW_FINDINGS.md) were sent:
1. Key corrections from our 225-issue factual accuracy audit (credibility matters)
2. DS9 MCC death investigation documents not previously listed
3. The March-July 2025 FBI evidence review conclusions (DS9)

---

## PART 1: KEY CORRECTIONS FROM THE FACTUAL ACCURACY AUDIT

We conducted a systematic audit of every report in this repository, identifying and correcting 225 factual accuracy issues across 43 phases covering ~50 report files. The corrections fall into these categories:

### 1A. Critical Factual Errors

| Correction | Details |
|-----------|---------|
| **Tom Barrack was ACQUITTED** | Multiple reports described Barrack as "convicted of acting as a UAE foreign agent." He was acquitted of all charges in November 2022. This error was propagated across 5+ reports and has been corrected in all of them. The [DUBAI_SULAYEM_INVESTIGATION.md](individuals/DUBAI_SULAYEM_INVESTIGATION.md) entry (#53 in the original guide, citing Barrack as context for Sultan bin Sulayem) should be read with this correction in mind. |
| **The "99-day blackout" was disproved** | The original [BLACKOUT_PERIOD_INVESTIGATION.md](evidence/BLACKOUT_PERIOD_INVESTIGATION.md) argued that a 99-day gap in Apple Mail PLIST email metadata (Nov 14, 2018 - Feb 21, 2019) represented a communication blackout. DS9 contains continuous daily jeevacation@gmail.com email activity throughout that entire period. The "blackout" was an artifact of DS11 PLIST extraction methodology, not actual communication silence. The report has been corrected. |
| **Flight log self-contradiction fixed** | [TRAFFICKING_ROUTES_INVESTIGATION.md](victims/TRAFFICKING_ROUTES_INVESTIGATION.md) contained a line stating pilot Rodgers "retroactively added passenger names to flight logs" — directly contradicting the same report's earlier correct statement (per [EFTA02731168](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2012/EFTA02731168.pdf) p.7) that Rodgers would NOT go back to add names. The error has been corrected. Flight logs are INCOMPLETE, not tampered with. |

### 1B. Legal Conclusion Corrections

The original reports frequently used legal conclusions as factual labels. These have been corrected throughout:

| Original Language | Corrected To | Why |
|------------------|-------------|-----|
| "Money laundering" | "Financial layering" or "funds movement" | Money laundering is a criminal charge requiring conviction. No Epstein associate has been convicted of money laundering. |
| "Complicit" | Described factually (e.g., "regulatory failures," "continued servicing the account") | "Complicit" is a legal conclusion implying criminal liability. |
| "Proves" | "Establishes" or "documents" | Analytical reports establish findings; criminal proof is for courts. |
| "Consciousness of guilt" | Attributed to prosecution or described factually | Legal term of art that should be attributed, not adopted as the report's own conclusion. |
| "Suppressed" (for prosecutorial decisions) | "Not pursued" or "declined to prosecute" | "Suppressed" implies deliberate concealment; prosecutors have discretion. |

### 1C. Why This Matters for Congress

These corrections strengthen, not weaken, the investigation's credibility. The underlying documentary evidence — 400+ EFTA citations, $755M in traced financial flows, victim testimony naming 30+ perpetrators — is unchanged. What changed is how the analysis characterizes that evidence. Congressional staff citing these reports should use the corrected language to avoid giving targets grounds for dismissal.

## PART 2: MCC DEATH INVESTIGATION — NEW DS9 DOCUMENTS

These documents from Dataset 9 were not in the original Congressional Reading Guide or Follow-Up. They concern the circumstances of Epstein's death at MCC New York on August 10, 2019.

### 2A. The Unmonitored Phone Call (Night Before Death)

| # | EFTA | What It Is | What To Look For |
|---|------|-----------|-----------------|
| 1 | **[EFTA00061927](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00061927.pdf)** | OIG interview transcript documenting an **unmonitored phone call** provided to Epstein on August 9, 2019 — the night before his death | "This call was done on an unmonitored line." "All inmate phone calls are recorded. So, why would an employee go on their own and provide a phone call to an offender?" A male answered and it was "handed off." **The recipient was never identified. Congress should demand the call records from the facility phone system.** |
| 2 | **[EFTA00115642](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00115642.pdf)** | Additional OIG interview on the phone call | "It could have potentially led to the incident, but we don't, we will never know." **Multiple officials found the call "extremely concerning."** |
| 3 | **[EFTA00115744](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00115744.pdf)** | Third OIG interview on the phone call | Further details on the unmonitored call. **Cross-reference all three transcripts for the complete picture.** |

### 2B. MCC Document Shredding

| # | EFTA | What It Is | What To Look For |
|---|------|-----------|-----------------|
| 4 | **[EFTA00068331](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00068331.pdf)** | FBI Crisis Intake memorandum, August 16, 2019 (6 days after death) | "4-5 bags of shredded documents" produced by BOP After-Actions team. Staff member said: "this isn't the first time I've had to do things like this." **Who ordered the shredding? What was destroyed?** |
| 5 | **[EFTA00078396](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00078396.pdf)** | OIG forwarding the shredding report | "They are shredding everything." **OIG documented institutional destruction of evidence.** |
| 6 | **[EFTA00092927](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00092927.pdf)** | USAO response to shredding report | "Can we take a look at the dumpster ASAP?" **Prosecutors treated this seriously. Was the dumpster examined? What was recovered?** |
| 7 | **[EFTA00089106](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00089106.pdf)** | Internal research into 18 USC 1519 elements | **Prosecutors researched the obstruction statute for document destruction — indicating they considered criminal charges for the shredding.** |

### 2C. TRUSCOPE Count Failures

| # | EFTA | What It Is | What To Look For |
|---|------|-----------|-----------------|
| 8 | **[EFTA00039972](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00039972.pdf)** | FD-302 interview confirming no counts were recorded | "There were no entries of counts in TRUSCOPE the entire night." The 3:00 AM and 5:00 AM physical counts — required to confirm each person in each cell — were never performed. |
| 9 | **[EFTA00064553](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00064553.pdf)** | Corroborating count failure documentation | Combined with DVR 2 failure (3 of 4 SHU cameras down since July 29), this created a near-complete surveillance gap in the SHU on the night of Epstein's death. |

### 2D. NARA Whistleblower Investigation

| # | EFTA | What It Is | What To Look For |
|---|------|-----------|-----------------|
| 10 | **[EFTA00172146](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00172146.pdf)** | April 2025: NARA investigated an ex-FBI agent whistleblower's claims that "people inside the FBI have been working night and day to destroy files on these servers." | NARA contacted FBI IMD, which contacted INSD. **INSD declined to investigate** without more specific allegations. IMD hit a "dead end." OGC/CDC was to draft a response. **This is the only documented federal investigation into potential evidence destruction — and it was not pursued. Congress should demand the INSD case file and ask why specifics were required when the allegation itself pointed to specific servers.** |

### 2E. Palm Beach Evidence

| # | EFTA | What It Is | What To Look For |
|---|------|-----------|-----------------|
| 11 | **[EFTA00082615](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00082615.pdf)** | FBI evidence item literally labeled "SHREDDED PAPER" | **Physical evidence of document destruction recovered from Epstein's Palm Beach property.** |

---

## PART 3: THE 2025 FBI EVIDENCE REVIEW (DS9)

In March-July 2025, newly appointed FBI Director Patel and Deputy Director Bongino requested a complete accounting of all Epstein evidence. DS9 contains the resulting internal communications. These definitively answer several major questions.

### 3A. What Was Found on the Devices

| # | EFTA | Finding |
|---|------|---------|
| 12 | **[EFTA00164742](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00164742.pdf)** | AUSA Maurene Comey to Director Patel/DD Bongino (March 21, 2025): **"There were no videos of any sexual abuse identified at any point in the investigation."** Over ONE MILLION images/videos reviewed. FBI had no legal authority to seize 2019 surveillance videos from residences. Nude photos of victims — "victims are alone in these photos." No males present. |
| 13 | **[EFTA00164897](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00164897.pdf)** | Director's Call (July 10, 2025): ~34,000 images marked responsive out of 1M+. **15-20 CSAM images (commercial, NOT self-produced).** ~90% adult pornography/erotica. "Approximately 4-5 victims accused other adult men sexually abused them. There was not enough evidence to federally charge these individuals, so the cases were referred to local law enforcement." |
| 14 | **[EFTA00164855](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00164855.pdf)** | MCC surveillance: **147 cameras, 8.08 TB total video data.** SHU cameras NOT active at time of death. Contraband phone (device 1B46) belonged to **Inmate Michael Thomas**, not Epstein. |
| 15 | **[EFTA00164740](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00164740.pdf)** | All evidence remains in FBI custody. CART creates 2 bit-for-bit copies of all digital evidence. **6 years after seizure, device examination had not been fully completed.** |
| 16 | **[EFTA00163550](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00163550.pdf)** | DOJ conclusions (July 2025): "No incriminating client list," no evidence of blackmail. AG Bondi stated many videos "turned out to be child porn" and will "never be released." |

### 3B. Camera-in-Clock: 2003 Origin

| # | EFTA | What It Is | What To Look For |
|---|------|-----------|-----------------|
| 17 | **[EFTA00157526](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00157526.pdf)** | Palm Beach PD report from **2003**: Epstein purchased a spy camera, concealed it "in a clock in his office" to catch a suspected thief. Camera recorded at 4:28 AM. **This is 2 years before the 2005 sex trafficking investigation.** The original purpose was anti-theft, not sexual surveillance — but it establishes that Epstein had concealed camera expertise as early as 2003. The Maxwell prosecution memo ([EFTA02731226](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2012/EFTA02731226.pdf)) later stated "Epstein had cameras in his clock." The FBI CID ([EFTA00038617](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00038617.pdf)) found no cameras "in any of the bedrooms or massage rooms" — a more limited claim. |

### 3C. Congressional Oversight Gaps

| # | EFTA | What It Is | What To Look For |
|---|------|-----------|-----------------|
| 18 | **[EFTA00161477](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00161477.pdf)** | Senator Marsha Blackburn sent a letter to Director Patel on February 24, 2025, requesting complete flight logs, Maxwell records with names, and additional items. FBI internal email from May 6, 2025: "Did we ever get the response?" — "I did not." **As of May 2025, the FBI had not responded to a sitting Senator's formal request — 10 weeks after the letter.** |
| 19 | **[EFTA00163673](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00163673.pdf)** | Bloomberg reported that the FBI FOIA team "played a central role in redacting former President Donald Trump's name — and the names of other high-profile individuals — from the Epstein investigation files" using FOIA privacy exemptions. **Congress should ask: Who authorized these specific redactions? Under what authority? How many names were redacted?** |

## SUMMARY: WHAT TO DO WITH THIS ADDENDUM

### For the Reading Room
Documents #1-3 (unmonitored phone call), #4-7 (shredding), and #10 (NARA investigation) are the highest priority additions. The phone call and shredding have never been publicly detailed. The NARA document reveals a whistleblower investigation that was terminated.

### For Congressional Inquiries
1. **Demand the call records** for the unmonitored phone Epstein used on August 9, 2019 (documents #1-3)
2. **Ask INSD** why they declined to investigate the evidence destruction whistleblower allegation (document #10)
3. **Ask the FBI** why Senator Blackburn's letter went unanswered for 10+ weeks (document #18)
4. **Ask the FBI** who authorized redacting Trump's name and other high-profile individuals from the files (document #19)
5. **Note the 2025 FBI conclusions** (documents #12-16) when evaluating claims about "blackmail videos" or "client lists" — the FBI's own review found neither

### For Credibility
Use the corrected language from Part 1 when citing these reports. The documentary evidence is strong; the analysis is now more precise.
