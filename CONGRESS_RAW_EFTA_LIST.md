# A. VICTIM TESTIMONY WITH REDACTED PERPETRATORS

### A1. Direct Victim Testimony and Impact Statements

| EFTA | Description | What Is Redacted | Why Congress Should Read It |
|------|-------------|-----------------|---------------------------|
| [EFTA02731420](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2012/EFTA02731420.pdf) | First victim journal (multi-page handwritten) -- names Leon Black ("threw me on the floor and blood all over Jeffreys carpet"), George Mitchell ("even old senators like George Mitchell who you think would be good like a grandpa are bad"), Larry Summers ("fucking disgusting"), Dershowitz ("Allen Douschewitz"), Ted Leonsis, Steve Case, Dan Snyder, Jim Kimsey, "The Gregorys," "Ms. Vicki," "Mr. Robert and Jill" | Ghost aliases (Mody, Sant, Ludwig, Cecchi, Mora, Goodlatte, Atkins, Caruthers, Islam, Conway, Jacobson) conceal identities of additional abusers -- victim explicitly stated these are "not who they say" | Documents a victim naming over 20 individuals including billionaires, senators, and sports owners in her own handwriting. Forensic examination found "no evidence found for recent fabrication." DANY investigators "do not doubt her allegations." |
| [EFTA02731465](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2012/EFTA02731465.pdf) | Second victim journal (8 pages) -- Ted Leonsis FILMED abuse (direct accusation of creating CSAM), Jes Staley "used belt leaving bloody marks," "Sauerkraut Krauss" and "Martin Minsky" named, AOL "used to find us," forced pregnancy/eugenics ("piano well = good genes"), forced abortions | No redactions -- this is raw handwriting -- but the four AOL executives named (Case, Kimsey, Leonsis, Vradenburg) were never investigated | The filming allegation against Leonsis, if true, constitutes production of CSAM -- a federal crime with no statute of limitations. The AOL platform accusation implicates a major corporation in victim recruitment. |
| [EFTA02731488](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2012/EFTA02731488.pdf) | FBI prosecution call notes -- "16 years old when raped by Black," "adult sex toys in victim's rectum and vagina," victim bleeding, refused medical attention, "would not take her to the doctor," flew victim out next day. Victim "trafficked to at least 25 different men." Biological mother "forced [victim] to perform sexual acts with adult men since she was very young. Her younger sister also. Even worse, the paternal grandfather... was in on it." | Leon Black's name is present but no charges were ever filed despite this FBI documentation | This is the FBI's own documentation of violent child rape by a billionaire. The detail level -- specific sexual implements, victim bleeding, denial of medical care -- is prosecution-grade evidence that was never used. |

Two victims describing identical distinctive violence patterns -- with no public information to copy from -- establishes pattern evidence. |
| [EFTA02731721](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2012/EFTA02731721.pdf) | Wigdor Law attorney letter -- victim trafficked by own family to Leon Black ("VIP") AND Larry Summers. Most explosive document in the entire investigation. | The victim's identity is redacted (appropriately), but the fact that neither Black nor Summers was ever investigated based on this letter is the failure | Documents a former Treasury Secretary and Harvard President as a direct recipient of a trafficking victim. This letter was in DOJ possession. |

Epstein proposed victim "bear his child" in exchange for mansion + monthly income, condition: "sign the child over to him" and child would be "his and Ghislaine's." Victim escaped to Thailand then Australia. | N/A | Documents international trafficking of prepubescent children from France. The forced-reproduction proposal is documented evidence of Epstein's eugenics program. |

The explicit requirement to "describe the events" proves information gathering for leverage was systematic, not incidental. |
| [EFTA01660651](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01660651.pdf) | NTOC tips compilation -- at age 16, caller attended 8 parties at Epstein's NY residence. "Two twin brothers, Allen and Oren, lured caller and her friend upstairs." "Oren raped her best friend and a third brother, Tal, raped a 14 year old girl named Katie LNU." Same caller: "big orgy parties" with "young girls and older Victoria's Secret models, including Bill Clinton and Donald Trump." | Alexander brothers were annotated by FBI as "possibly identifiable" but received ZERO follow-up in the Epstein case. They are currently on trial in SDNY (Jan 2026) for trafficking 60+ women. | FBI had rapists identified in their own tip database and failed to investigate. These same individuals are now being prosecuted for trafficking 60+ women -- a case that could have been broken years earlier. |

Describes sexual transactional dynamics ("babydolls," "I know what you expect from me"), shoplifting arrest, failing model career, Westminster International University, expiring visa, financial desperation | Recovered from beneath failed redaction overlay -- entire email was supposed to be hidden | This document was REDACTED -- someone tried to hide it.

# KEY TAKEAWAYS FOR CONGRESSIONAL INQUIRY

1. **The 2005 computer forensic image ([EFTA00015823](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00015823.pdf))** from the peak abuse period has never been examined by federal authorities, and no federal warrant was ever obtained. (Note: PBCSO Computer Crimes Unit created the image and may have conducted local examination.) Congress can demand the federal warrant be obtained.

2. **$64 million flowed to Honeycomb Partners** and nobody knows who controls it. Congress can subpoena the records.

3. **4+ victims accused Leon Black of violent rape** with FBI documentation, $62.5M settlement, and a video allegation. No charges. Congress can ask why.

4. **VHS surveillance tapes ([EFTA00007741](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%204/EFTA00007741.pdf)/7984/7987/7990)** from Epstein's properties have never been viewed. Congress can demand they be scanned.

5. **The Austrian passport investigation ([EFTA00025539](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00025539.pdf))** was abandoned 25 days before Epstein's death. Congress can demand the investigation be completed.

6. **Bannon-Epstein texts** were found on a phone already in FBI custody and deliberately not read. Congress can demand they be reviewed.

7. **The FOIA exemption ([EFTA00015219](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00015219.pdf))** confirms classified information about Epstein's "confidential relationship with a foreign government." Congress can demand declassification.

8. **$189 million flowed through Deutsche Bank AFTER the bank documented its own compliance failures.** No individual banker was criminally charged.

9. **The FBI claimed "no cameras" ([EFTA00038617](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00038617.pdf)) while the prosecution's own memo stated "cameras in his clock" ([EFTA02731226](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2012/EFTA02731226.pdf)).** This contradiction has never been reconciled.

10. **The MCC obtained replacement hard drives on August 9, 2019 and never installed them.** Epstein was found dead the next morning. Congress can demand accountability.
